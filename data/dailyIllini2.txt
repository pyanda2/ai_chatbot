Jeffery Brown will step down as dean of the Gies College of Business at the end of this academic year in 2024, per a press release from the college on Tuesday.
Brown, who earned his doctorate in economics from MIT and his bachelor’s degree from Miami University of Ohio, joined the college faculty in 2002 as a professor of finance. He has served as dean since 2015. 
His decision to step down means that he will finish his second five-year term, slated to end a year early in May 2025.
When he began his tenure as dean, Brown promised three key commitments: access, innovation and excellence. 
These commitments led to the reconceptualization of the college’s undergraduate and graduate programs as well as greater support for faculty members, Brown said in a video message. 

The shift to online courses and degree offerings, in particular through the University’s iMBA program, was implemented to provide greater accessibility, adapt to new learning methods and lower barriers to education. 
“We’ve more than doubled the number of learners that we serve each year,” Brown said. “We pioneered the future of online education and showed the world that it’s possible to democratize education.” 
Brown was also responsible for completing a record-breaking funding initiative in which the college received the “Gies” surname. 
“(Brown) will be most remembered for ushering in the largest single gift in the history of the University of Illinois — a $150 million naming gift from Larry and Beth Gies in 2017,” the press release said. 
According to the press release, Brown believes it is time to transition to a new dean and start a new chapter for the college. The next dean’s tenure will begin with the opening of Wymer Hall, a new academic facility set to open in early 2025. 
“This marks a wonderful time to transition to a new dean so they can open our beautiful new facility, lead these conversations and then deliver the next round of innovation,” Brown said. 
Now, the University will launch a “global search” for the college’s 11th dean. 
Brown ended his message by bidding farewell and expressing his gratitude to the campus community. 
“Serving as dean of Gies is by far the most exciting, impactful and gratifying job I’ve ever held and I owe so much of that to all of you,” Brown said.

The University’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions published its annual first-year enrollment report on Monday.
The report, which is compiled each fall semester on the 10th day of classes, includes data representing trends such as the selectivity of the previous application cycle, yield rates, diversity of the first-year class and tuition contribution by college and residency.
Notably, this year’s report demonstrates record high enrollment, a record low 43.7% acceptance rate, higher yield, a record high 21.5% of “underrepresented minority” students and an increased number of first-generation students.
According to Allison Copenbarger Vance, director of messaging at the Office of the Chancellor, the increase in minority representation could be a result of the Illinois Commitment scholarship program.
“Students from underrepresented groups increased or stayed the same in every category in the freshman class, which is something we’re really proud of,” Vance said. “I think part of this, though not all of the reason, is probably because we’re seeing some results from our financial aid programs.”

With a yearly estimated cost of attendance ranging from $35,000 to $45,000, the University has introduced programs that make an Illinois degree more affordable for students with financial need.
The Illinois Commitment scholarship program covers tuition and fees for all students with a household income below the state median. 
Vance said that the University is working to communicate the potential affordability of an Illinois education to prospective students, including the Illinois Commitment program.
“For some, there’s a perception that the University is really expensive, but that is really focusing on the sticker price,” Vance said. “I think one of the reasons that we have a higher number of underrepresented students, but also first-generation students, is because we’re doing a better job of being more clear about the access and affordability of an Illinois education.”
Diversity in college acceptances has remained a priority since the recent Supreme Court decision outlawing race-aware admissions practices in U.S. colleges and universities, according to Vance.
“I think that with the (recent Supreme Court affirmative action) ruling, we will ensure that everything that we’re doing, our practices and our policies are going to continue to fully comply with federal state laws,” Vance explained. “At the same time, we are reiterating our commitment to promoting access, equity, inclusion and continuing to increase an inclusive and welcoming environment.”
The report also included figures indicating the proportion of out-of-state and in-state students in the incoming first-year class.
“We are the state flagship university,” Vance said. “We’re so excited that we have the highest number of Illinois residents in almost the last 20 years, which is really exciting. We view it as part of our mission — continuing to serve our in-state students.”
Another indicator that has changed in the past admissions cycle is the percent of students accepted out of those who applied. 
Since the fall 2022 admissions cycle, the University has accepted the Common Application in addition to its proprietary application platform, MyIllini. This move, according to Vance, has contributed to a larger applicant pool and decrease in acceptance rates.
“Before we accepted the Common App, every individual student that wanted to apply to our institution would have to send a separate application,” Vance explained. “By eliminating that barrier of application and making it easier, I do think that’s probably a reason that we have a recent lowering in acceptance rates.”
Along with a decreased acceptance rate, the report included an increase in yield — a statistic that describes the proportion of students who accept their place in the first-year class.
“Anytime we see an increase, it’s really hard to pinpoint it to one specific reason,” Vance said. “That being said, we are really prioritizing talking about the Illinois experience and what all of that entails. We’re continually reminding prospective students that our students go on to get excellent jobs and have fulfilling careers.”
This year’s report also boasts the highest number of first-generation college students admitted to the University in recent years. According to Vance, this growth signifies the positive impact of University programs.
“The data shows that if you are the first in your family to attend college, it has positive ripple effects to your immediate family and even your family down generations,” Vance said. “We love to be able to play a part in those families and in those communities.”
Vance said that one of the most exciting developments for the University is its increased support of nontraditional students.
One way that nontraditional students gain access to a University education is through its certificate programs. According to Vance, the growth the University has seen in nondegree certificate program enrollment is an indication that demand is being met.
“I don’t think that certificates would ever replace the traditional student experience, but they’re an amazing thing that we sought for an addition,” Vance said. “This is only the second year that we’ve offered the certificate, and we saw a 32% increase in those students. We want to extend an Illinois education to those who maybe can’t come and live here for four years.”
The certificate program, according to Vance, complements Illinois Extension, which is a University department that seeks to provide access to University resources in rural areas across Illinois.
“There are Illinois Extension offices in so many counties throughout the state — so they actually are doing educational work there,” Vance explained. “They started with kind of an agricultural base, but, you know, the extension is doing education across all kinds of different disciplines and expertise. These certificates are … a different avenue through which we can help people to learn a bunch of different topics … in a way that really meets them where they are.”

Chancellor Robert Jones announced in a Massmail on Wednesday that John Coleman, a dean and political science professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, has been appointed vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost for the University, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.
The position, of which Chancellor Jones referred to in the mass mail and in the past “as one of the most desirable academic leadership positions in all of American higher education,” oversees campus academic programs, priorities and policies, working closely with the chancellor, other vice chancellors, deans and the University Senate, according to the Office of the Provost’s website. 
William Bernhard, a professor of political science, served in the position in the interim. 
“(Bernhard’s) collaborative and consultative approach has brought stability with continued forward movement in our academic operations as we searched for a permanent provost,” Jones said.  
Bernhard will continue in the role until July, and Coleman, should he be confirmed, will start on July 19. 

The effort to fill the vacancy, most recently held in a permanent capacity by Andreas Cangellaris, was “extensive,” according to Chancellor Jones. 
“I charged our committee and our entire campus to take the necessary time and invest the extensive effort to find the best candidate to lead our academic missions forward with the vision and urgency our state expects from its flagship university,” Jones said.
The search committee, headed by Jeff Brown, dean of the Gies College of Business, held several public forums and livestreamed meetings in evaluating candidates from what Jones called “an impressive pool.” 
Coleman was selected out of several finalists from across the U.S. including Elliott Cheu, Venetria Patton, Norma Bouchard, Patrick Wolfe and Rosario Ceballo through a process that included several forums over the course of two years.
In an email to the University community, Jones said Coleman has established an “international reputation as an educator, scholar and academic leader.”
“Having served nearly his entire academic career in Big Ten, public, land-grant research universities, he comes to Illinois with a deep and profound understanding of our foundational obligations to translate knowledge, education and exploration into better lives for those we serve,” Jones said.  
Coleman started his academic career at the University of Texas before serving as a faculty member and department chair of the University of Wisconsin Political Science Department. 
He is currently a professor of political science and the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Minnesota. He holds a doctorate in political science from MIT and has been president of the political organizations and political parties section of the American Political Science Association.
In an email about what he hopes to accomplish in his new position, Coleman said he wants to make sure the university is expanding opportunities for engagement in research, study abroad programs and internships. 
“In the curriculum, we’ll want to find ways to add flexibility through online options, a greater mix of courses beyond the standard full-semester 3-credit hour class, and pull together new interdisciplinary minors and other options,” Coleman added. 
The incoming Provost emphasized the need to be “attentive every day” to how the overall student experience is being improved and “how a campus that truly makes diversity, inclusion, and belonging central to how we operate,” is being ensured. 
Coleman said he’d also want UIUC “to be a campus that models how there can be dialogue, even amidst passionate disagreement, across difference.” 
He said it troubled him to see surveys from across the U.S. showing that students from across the political spectrum are “wary of sharing their views and religious beliefs.” 
“Why wait for other institutions to figure this out?” Coleman asked. “Let Illinois set the model for robust and productive dialogue and discussion.” 
Other areas of focus for Coleman included finances, mental health, and supporting students towards career pathways. 
“Students want a life with meaning and they want to have a positive impact on the world, which is entirely consistent with my interest in having us think about how we as an institution can be the best for the world in what we do.” Coleman said. 
Jones ended his email by mentioning a simple yet profound statement made by Coleman during the evaluation process that became a “defining moment in the search.” 
Jones said Coleman told the committee he believed Illinois should not only be the best University “in” the world, but also “for” the world. 
“This kind of bold thinking — setting the very highest expectations for us when our society’s needs have never been greater — resonated with so many of us because it is so true to the spirit of innovation and service that has defined our university for 155 years,” Jones said. 
Jones also said Coleman’s “appointment is pending approval by the Board of Trustees, and he will hold the title of  ‘designate’ until that time.”

The position, of which Chancellor Jones referred to in the mass mail and in the past “as one of the most desirable academic leadership positions in all of American higher education,” oversees campus academic programs, priorities and policies, working closely with the chancellor, other vice chancellors, deans and the University Senate, according to the Office of the Provost’s website. 
William Bernhard, a professor of political science, served in the position in the interim. 
“(Bernhard’s) collaborative and consultative approach has brought stability with continued forward movement in our academic operations as we searched for a permanent provost,” Jones said.  
Bernhard will continue in the role until July, and Coleman, should he be confirmed, will start on July 19. 

The effort to fill the vacancy, most recently held in a permanent capacity by Andreas Cangellaris, was “extensive,” according to Chancellor Jones. 
“I charged our committee and our entire campus to take the necessary time and invest the extensive effort to find the best candidate to lead our academic missions forward with the vision and urgency our state expects from its flagship university,” Jones said.
The search committee, headed by Jeff Brown, dean of the Gies College of Business, held several public forums and livestreamed meetings in evaluating candidates from what Jones called “an impressive pool.” 
Coleman was selected out of several finalists from across the U.S. including Elliott Cheu, Venetria Patton, Norma Bouchard, Patrick Wolfe and Rosario Ceballo through a process that included several forums over the course of two years.
In an email to the University community, Jones said Coleman has established an “international reputation as an educator, scholar and academic leader.”
“Having served nearly his entire academic career in Big Ten, public, land-grant research universities, he comes to Illinois with a deep and profound understanding of our foundational obligations to translate knowledge, education and exploration into better lives for those we serve,” Jones said.  
Coleman started his academic career at the University of Texas before serving as a faculty member and department chair of the University of Wisconsin Political Science Department. 
He is currently a professor of political science and the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Minnesota. He holds a doctorate in political science from MIT and has been president of the political organizations and political parties section of the American Political Science Association.
In an email about what he hopes to accomplish in his new position, Coleman said he wants to make sure the university is expanding opportunities for engagement in research, study abroad programs and internships. 
“In the curriculum, we’ll want to find ways to add flexibility through online options, a greater mix of courses beyond the standard full-semester 3-credit hour class, and pull together new interdisciplinary minors and other options,” Coleman added. 
The incoming Provost emphasized the need to be “attentive every day” to how the overall student experience is being improved and “how a campus that truly makes diversity, inclusion, and belonging central to how we operate,” is being ensured. 
Coleman said he’d also want UIUC “to be a campus that models how there can be dialogue, even amidst passionate disagreement, across difference.” 
He said it troubled him to see surveys from across the U.S. showing that students from across the political spectrum are “wary of sharing their views and religious beliefs.” 
“Why wait for other institutions to figure this out?” Coleman asked. “Let Illinois set the model for robust and productive dialogue and discussion.” 
Other areas of focus for Coleman included finances, mental health, and supporting students towards career pathways. 
“Students want a life with meaning and they want to have a positive impact on the world, which is entirely consistent with my interest in having us think about how we as an institution can be the best for the world in what we do.” Coleman said. 
Jones ended his email by mentioning a simple yet profound statement made by Coleman during the evaluation process that became a “defining moment in the search.” 
Jones said Coleman told the committee he believed Illinois should not only be the best University “in” the world, but also “for” the world. 
“This kind of bold thinking — setting the very highest expectations for us when our society’s needs have never been greater — resonated with so many of us because it is so true to the spirit of innovation and service that has defined our university for 155 years,” Jones said. 
Jones also said Coleman’s “appointment is pending approval by the Board of Trustees, and he will hold the title of  ‘designate’ until that time.”

By Anneliese Cornejo Garcia and Jessie Wang April 17, 2023
On Jan. 20, the Illinois Board of Trustees approved tuition increases for incoming in-state freshmen starting in fall 2023. 
“These modest increases will allow our universities to maintain the excellence that students and their families expect and manage inflationary pressures that are driving up our expenses,” said Tim Killeen, president of the University of Illinois System.
For in-state freshmen attending the University of Illinois and the University of Illinois at Chicago, tuition will increase by 1.9%. Current in-state undergraduate students and students planning to attend the University of Illinois at Springfield will not be affected by tuition changes. 
For out-of-state students and international freshmen, tuition will increase between 2.2-2.5% at the University of Illinois and the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
“This decision by trustees, alongside our commitment to providing financial aid that makes a real difference in students’ lives, aligns with our promise to maintain access and affordability at our universities,” Killeen said. 

According to the Education Data Initiative, Illinois had the fourth-highest public in-state tuition rate at an average of $14,455 in 2022. 
Krupa Sudheendra, incoming freshman, said she was wary about the change in tuition. 
“I mean, $200 is still a lot for a college student, so they should not increase that any more,” she said. 
David Mercer, senior writer and associate director of executive communications at the University, said this is the second increase in tuition in the past eight years. He said the change reflects the rise of operation costs for all three universities in the University of Illinois System. 
According to Mercer, these operation costs cover “food served to students in dining halls to the supplies needed in our classrooms and materials and equipment used in research.” 
Enrollment has also set a record-high every year for the past 10 years, according to the University. Over the past six years, student enrollment increased by 16%. 
The University reported a 44.8% acceptance rate for the 2022-2023 school year. The total rate accounts for a freshman enrollment of 6,790 students, according to the University’s Division of Information. 
Lane Pederson, the mother of an incoming in-state freshman, said their family doesn’t believe they will be greatly affected by the moderate tuition increase.
“We aren’t worried about it too much at this point, being in-state with (access to) grants and scholarships,” Pederson said.

With Homecoming Week quickly approaching, spectators should expect police presence at a range of events from Oct. 15-21. 
On Oct. 15, the University will offer a variety of events for Illini fans, such as the Homecoming 5k on Oct. 15 and the FAA Friends & FamILLy Celebration on Oct. 18. The week caps off with the Fighting Illini facing the Wisconsin Badgers in Memorial Stadium. 
Amid the tailgates, parades and celebrations, Patrick Wade, senior director of strategic communications at the University, advises the public to be informed on which parts of campus will be under advisory.
“We shut down roads around the stadium, six hours in advance of the game,” Wade said. “That’s going to be completely normal. You can compare it to any other football game throughout the season.”
Police coverage of the game itself will be no different than that of a normal football game. However, the route for the parade will cause traffic blockages that could revert certain fan routes. 

“Essentially the parade route will be closed during the parade, and that’s obviously to allow the parade to proceed to make sure that spectators have a place where they can enjoy the parade and be safe,” Wade said.
The parade will start at 6 p.m. on Oct. 21 and will close portions of Fourth Street, Gregory Drive and First Street for about 30 minutes. However, after the parade, Grange Grove will host a pep rally that will be under police supervision. 
“Just like any other football game, we have officer assignments that cover the band, the tailgating areas, inside the stadium and different traffic posts,” Wade said. “Then any fan restrictions around the game are pretty consistent across the board.”
Despite these restrictions, the University of Illinois Police Department’s goal is to ensure that spectators from across the country have a safe and enjoyable experience on campus.
“We obviously have a lot of visitors coming into our community for Homecoming,” Wade said. “We’re always happy to see them. We try to be welcoming to them and make sure that they have the opportunity to feel nostalgic about Illinois, and enjoy the football game and any of the other Homecoming events in a safe way.”

Dylan Bogash, senior in LAS, toured several campus apartments before transferring to the University in the fall of 2022. When she saw a relatively inexpensive one-bedroom apartment on the Smile Student Living website, Bogash decided to tour the space.
“On the website, it was a beautiful, spacious unit full of natural light,” Bogash said.
When she arrived at the building, Bogash said the unit being shown was a far cry from the one she was expecting.
“When I got there, we were touring the basement unit, which was moldy and had no windows,” Bogash said. “When I talked to the realtor, I told her this was not what I drove down here for, and they took no accountability. It just felt so swept under the rug.”
According to Thomas Betz, director of Office of Student Legal Services at the University, although there is nothing illegal about this practice, it is sometimes predatory.

“It’s almost like the term bait and switch — they bait you with the beautiful apartment and they switch it,” Betz said. “Don’t sign the lease until you see the actual unit. The trick is, that is really difficult to do if you’re in Beijing.”
For many students, a campus visit before signing a lease is not an accessible option — either due to sheer distance from Champaign-Urbana or other limiting factors. Still, Betz said the leasing company has almost no legal obligation to be transparent about their offerings.
“There’s no definition of luxury; it’s puffery and it just doesn’t have much meaning,” Betz said. “They can always win that case. When they show the model on their website and YouTube, there’s a little fine print that always says ‘this is a model.’”
Betz said that there are certain things about an apartment, such as the advertised quantity of bedrooms, plumbing, running water or heating, that the leasing company has an obligation to provide. Other things, unless explicitly promised in the lease, are not obligatory.
According to Betz, the first line of defense students have against issues with their apartments is reading and understanding their lease in its entirety.
“Students will come to (University Student Legal Services) and say ‘I want to challenge, I want to blah, blah, blah,’” Betz said. “I always say, ‘Let’s look at the lease.’ I always make students read the lease. I say, ‘Well, on page 3, you’ve agreed to this.’ … I’m not knocking you, you just didn’t read your lease.” 
The leases brought forth by many realtors, Betz explained, are extensive and often require tenants to waive crucial rights in assumption that they won’t read the fine print.
“You have some of these leases, you sign everything away except your firstborn,” Betz said, laughing. “Sometimes you’re signing away your right to make a complaint about mold and bedbugs, which I think is ridiculous — but I see them all the time.”
According to Betz, there are legal rights for students whose landlords are not meeting expectations outlined in their leases. Betz also said that landlords have a responsibility to maintain certain basic standards of living.
First, Betz advises that students save records of every complaint or maintenance request — particularly with code violations.
“They need to go to the landlord, do a screenshot and when it’s not quickly resolved, they need to go to the city and get a code inspection,” Betz said. “Both cities do have the power to close them down if necessary on an (unsolved) heat or plumbing issue.”
According to Andrew Greenlee, professor in FAA, predatory practices are often more impactful within the campus community because students are likely first-time renters.
“Part of the challenge for new housing consumers, new renters, more generally, is that oftentimes they don’t yet have experience,” Greenlee said. “Students often don’t understand what recourse they have if those promises are not fulfilled by a landlord or by a property owner.”
Greenlee said that students are susceptible to this kind of a practice due to a variety of factors that are unique to their experience.
“They often take advantage of a population that is geographically constrained and have to move here, … financially constrained, but also have, in many cases, a lack of information to fight back against approaches that are predatory in nature,” Greenlee said.
Garrett Jurina, sophomore in LAS, said he lives in a Smile Student Living-managed apartment that does not have a working fire alarm. According to Jurina, he is within his rights to withhold rent and report the issue to the city of Champaign.
“They haven’t even gotten back to me, but I told them that I’m withholding rent until they fix the fire alarm because it basically means our apartment is legally uninhabitable,” Jurina explained.
According to Jurina, these behaviors on the part of Smile are symptomatic of a predatory market.
“There’s always going to be a demand on campus for student housing,” Jurina said. “No matter what they offer as a price, students are going to have to live somewhere. There aren’t enough dorms or University housing to house all the students on campus, so I think they just take advantage of that to bump prices up.”

“There’s no definition of luxury; it’s puffery and it just doesn’t have much meaning,” Betz said. “They can always win that case. When they show the model on their website and YouTube, there’s a little fine print that always says ‘this is a model.’”
Betz said that there are certain things about an apartment, such as the advertised quantity of bedrooms, plumbing, running water or heating, that the leasing company has an obligation to provide. Other things, unless explicitly promised in the lease, are not obligatory.
According to Betz, the first line of defense students have against issues with their apartments is reading and understanding their lease in its entirety.
“Students will come to (University Student Legal Services) and say ‘I want to challenge, I want to blah, blah, blah,’” Betz said. “I always say, ‘Let’s look at the lease.’ I always make students read the lease. I say, ‘Well, on page 3, you’ve agreed to this.’ … I’m not knocking you, you just didn’t read your lease.” 
The leases brought forth by many realtors, Betz explained, are extensive and often require tenants to waive crucial rights in assumption that they won’t read the fine print.
“You have some of these leases, you sign everything away except your firstborn,” Betz said, laughing. “Sometimes you’re signing away your right to make a complaint about mold and bedbugs, which I think is ridiculous — but I see them all the time.”
According to Betz, there are legal rights for students whose landlords are not meeting expectations outlined in their leases. Betz also said that landlords have a responsibility to maintain certain basic standards of living.
First, Betz advises that students save records of every complaint or maintenance request — particularly with code violations.
“They need to go to the landlord, do a screenshot and when it’s not quickly resolved, they need to go to the city and get a code inspection,” Betz said. “Both cities do have the power to close them down if necessary on an (unsolved) heat or plumbing issue.”
According to Andrew Greenlee, professor in FAA, predatory practices are often more impactful within the campus community because students are likely first-time renters.
“Part of the challenge for new housing consumers, new renters, more generally, is that oftentimes they don’t yet have experience,” Greenlee said. “Students often don’t understand what recourse they have if those promises are not fulfilled by a landlord or by a property owner.”
Greenlee said that students are susceptible to this kind of a practice due to a variety of factors that are unique to their experience.
“They often take advantage of a population that is geographically constrained and have to move here, … financially constrained, but also have, in many cases, a lack of information to fight back against approaches that are predatory in nature,” Greenlee said.
Garrett Jurina, sophomore in LAS, said he lives in a Smile Student Living-managed apartment that does not have a working fire alarm. According to Jurina, he is within his rights to withhold rent and report the issue to the city of Champaign.
“They haven’t even gotten back to me, but I told them that I’m withholding rent until they fix the fire alarm because it basically means our apartment is legally uninhabitable,” Jurina explained.
According to Jurina, these behaviors on the part of Smile are symptomatic of a predatory market.
“There’s always going to be a demand on campus for student housing,” Jurina said. “No matter what they offer as a price, students are going to have to live somewhere. There aren’t enough dorms or University housing to house all the students on campus, so I think they just take advantage of that to bump prices up.”

In a recent national university ranking conducted by the U.S. News & World Report, the University of Illinois climbed from No. 41 last year to No. 35 today. 
The Grainger College of Engineering and the Gies College of Business received high rankings in the report. Engineering was ranked No. 5 in the best undergraduate engineering programs. Several programs in Business were ranked in the top 10, with accounting ranked second and insurance ranked eighth.
The University is ranked No. 12 in top public schools, tied with the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
Gisselle de la Cruz, junior in LAS, explains that the University’s constant high ranking of the top public schools drew her to apply.
“One of the reasons I chose to attend UI is because they teach their students how to be successful in any area,” de la Cruz said.

In May, U.S. News and World Report announced that they would be changing the methodology of ranking schools to place more emphasis on students’ success and remove “alumni giving, faculty with terminal degree, class size and high school standing” as ranking metrics.
The administration expressed positive feedback to the changes in the ranking indicators.
According to a statement from the Office of the Chancellor, “It is good to see some of these companies making adjustments to their rankings to give more weight to factors that speak to a university’s efforts in areas around educational access, affordability and achievement.” 
The statement added that the presence of many highly ranked programs reflects the University’s goals of “delivering excellence on a massive scale.”
The chancellor said in the statement that “the ranking that always matters most to us is the one our students make when they selected Illinois as their top choice for their college education.”

On Wednesday afternoon, the College of Agricultural, Consumer & Environmental Sciences and the college of Liberal Arts & Sciences held their annual career fair for students. The career fair was held in the Illini Union from 1-6 p.m.
Employers and recruiters were invited to set up booths and talk to students about internships and prospective career opportunities. There was a great variety of work experience students could choose from.
“We are always looking for students to fill our positions,” said Carolyn Villa, an ecologist working for V3. “We’ve had so many students come through and be seasonal with us for a couple of years and then move on to bigger and better things.”
The career fair invited students of all years and majors to have the opportunity to explore the workforce and make connections. Students were encouraged to wear business attire and have their portfolios ready. 
Some students reported going to the career fair simply to see what their options were. The mix of agricultural sciences and liberal arts allowed students to be exposed to career opportunities that they may not have been exposed to otherwise. 

“I just saw a dog organization and I used to work with dogs,” said Julia Persak, freshman in ACES. “I was so excited that I could kind of tie that into my major.”
The semi-professional environment allowed students to enjoy an easier and less stressful interview process. “There are a lot of people but I like the atmosphere,” said Elen Huang, junior in ACES.
The career fair also provided recruiters the chance to get the word out about their company. Many recruiters mentioned their appreciation for the event, and why companies choose to come to the University. 
“I love coming to U of I,” said Cara Ladd, a recruitment director for Teach for America. “The students are always so prepared with their questions and with information.”

The Student Organization Resource Fee Board announced changes in funding standards for the 2023-24 academic year.
SORF is used to help fund programs and services of Registered Student Organizations. 
In a press release sent out on Sept. 8, SORF notified student organizations of the new funding model that the vice chancellor for student affairs approved. 
The statement said that the funding model changes the total allocation for each fiscal year from $10,000 to $5,000.
In addition, SORF announced that they would use the total number of Illinois student attendees as a metric to determine funding. 

“As only students pay the Student Organization Resource Fee, only Illinois students are entitled to its benefits,” the statement said. 
Navika Kagathi, sophomore in Engineering, discusses how the sudden change is going to affect car racing RSO’s that use SORF funding.
“With this decision, these RSOs won’t be able to make their cars, so they won’t be able compete in competitions,” Kagathi said.
Jose Reyes, senior in Engineering, felt similarly, saying that the lack of University funding for RSOs will affect their ability to provide services to students.
“I believe that this is putting student RSOs at a disadvantage as there aren’t those funds provided,” Reyes said.
Troy Kowalski, SORF treasurer, explains why the funding for RSOs has decreased.
“This change allows more organizations to apply for funding and to take advantage of the SORF board without (SORF) running out of money,” Kowalsk said.
The SORF applications for funding are due Sunday. More information about SORF can be found on their website. 
“I encourage RSOs to apply for as much as they need of the $5,000,” Kowalski said. “We are going to review the applications fairly and in (an) orderly process. ”

 Editor’s Note:
 
An earlier version of the headline was “SORF cuts RSO funding by 50%.” This was changed on Sept. 27, 2023 because SORF is not cutting funding, but instead reducing maximum funding allocations. Additionally, an earlier version stated that SORF receives funding through tuition. This was corrected to reflect that SORF receives funding through a Student Initiated Fee.

The Grainger College of Engineering held its Fall 2023 Engineering Career Fair on Wednesday and Thursday. The Illini Union hosted the event from noon to 5 p.m. Unlike last year, there was no online version of this fair. 
Crowe Global, Union Pacific Railroad, Northern Trust and many more companies attended this year’s fair. 
Employers at Union Pacific said, “We have been coming off and on for over 10 years.”
Union Pacific mentioned how they find great success from certain majors at Illinois, mainly from the computer science and engineering departments. 
Depending on background and experience, Union Pacific mentioned how they prefer to take people in between their sophomore and junior year. They did note, however, that “there are rare occasions when we’ll take someone between their freshman and sophomore year.” 

According to the college’s website, the career fair is one of the main events and attracts around 7,000 people in the fall and 3,000 people in the spring. 
Sierra Roby with Northern Trust, a global financial services firm based out of Chicago, said, “I think we may have spoken to around 80 to 100 people today, and we are looking to hire for around 30 roles.” 
Roby highlighted that there were other universities Northern Trust was hiring from as well. 
Aalia Angirish, sophomore in Engineering, said that the event was tiring with how many students from other colleges than Grainger attended. 
“I came in with no expectations because I was not sure how it would go, but surprisingly handed out more resumes than I thought I would and formed connections with a lot of recruiters.”

--- Content from https://dailyillini.com/news-stories/campus-life/2023/09/10/a-history-of-black-student-housing-at-ui/ ---

The first Black student enrolled at the University of Illinois in 1887. However, Black student enrollment remained extremely low until the late 1960s. Here is an overview of the history of Black student housing at the University.
 
Early years
Jessica Ballard, archivist for multicultural collections and services at the University Archives, said the University did not have many housing accommodations available around the late 19th century.  
“Campus housing was just very small — most students weren’t living on campus, but a lot of students were living very close to campus,” Ballard said. 

According to Ballard, since the community had “restrictive covenants” on Black residents at the time, the Black community primarily lived on the north end of Champaign.
“That’s pretty much where a lot of black students were living as well,” Ballard said. “If they weren’t from the community, … there (were) often people in the Black community that would open up their homes (to students).” 
Although early data is sparse, Albert Lee kept extensive records on housing and recruitment of Black students. Lee began as a messenger but eventually became the chief clerk to the University president.
Lee is known as the “unofficial dean of Black students” and was instrumental in assisting Black students in school and housing around this time period. 
“He worked closely with the community to help them find homes, he was also very active at his church, Bethel AME,” Ballard said. 
 
Postwar period
It wasn’t until 1946 that the first Black students — Quintella King and Ruthe Cash — lived in University Housing in Evans Hall. 
In a research paper written by professor Joy Ann Williamson titled “The Snail-Like Progress of Racial Desegregation at the University of Illinois,” other Black women would follow. 
However, even though the dorms were desegregated by providing female Black students with housing contracts, Black and white women were not allowed to room together, Williamson said. 
Williamson added that discriminatory practices from landlords and prohibitory contracts further limited the housing options available. 
Ballard noted that during the period following World War II, the one exception to living in the north end was fraternities and sororities, many of which owned houses closer to campus. 
Examples of such include fraternities Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi and sorority Delta Sigma Theta, all of which were featured in the 1946 issue of the Illio.  
“The north end …  might have been about a 30-minute walk one way,” Ballard said. “So (Black students) still felt their community wasn’t (as) present as they would have liked.” 
Williamson echoed Ballard on the challenges of living in the north end, noting that “traveling to and from campus by foot meant lost time for study and recreation, while white students could take advantage of both.”
 
Post-1960 
Housing and discrimination continued to be a challenge for Black students, even as the Black student population grew in the late 1960’s with Project 500 — an effort to bring in diverse students and offer equal educational opportunities in 1968.  
According to the University Archives, Project 500 consisted of mostly Black and Latino students. 
Ballard said that the influx of Black students in 1968 aided the Black Power movement led by the Black Student Association.  
“The Black Student Association on campus …  (pushed) a lot of things forward with the Black Power movement because they were organizing in 1967,” Ballard said. “When you start to get more black students by 1968, that really made a difference, because there were more voices.”
However, she points out that issues arose when the administration did not fulfill many of the promises that they had made students in the Project 500 program. 
“There were some students who were promised certain things by recruiters, such as certain financial aid packages that didn’t go through,” Ballard noted. “There were some students who were sleeping in lounges.”
Project 500 students eventually organized a sit-in in hopes that the administration would address their frustrations. 
“These students (are) trying to have the same accommodations as other students, and it’s not happening, which led to the big sit-in in 1968,” Ballard said. “They had a list of demands that they hoped Chancellor Peltason would meet with them about.”
Ballard said that the event was peaceful, with people sitting and playing cards whilst waiting for the chancellor to meet with them. 
“The response was that early in the morning, the police came with dogs and there were over 200 students that were arrested,” Ballard said. 
Eventually, though, Chancellor Peltason conceded to some of the demands of students. 
“Chancellor Peltason did concede … (to) having a Black Cultural Center,” Ballard said. “Black Studies also started to emerge, the Black chorus as well … so it really was a movement that brought a lot of programs that are still highly valued today.”

“Campus housing was just very small — most students weren’t living on campus, but a lot of students were living very close to campus,” Ballard said. 
According to Ballard, since the community had “restrictive covenants” on Black residents at the time, the Black community primarily lived on the north end of Champaign.
“That’s pretty much where a lot of black students were living as well,” Ballard said. “If they weren’t from the community, … there (were) often people in the Black community that would open up their homes (to students).” 
Although early data is sparse, Albert Lee kept extensive records on housing and recruitment of Black students. Lee began as a messenger but eventually became the chief clerk to the University president.
Lee is known as the “unofficial dean of Black students” and was instrumental in assisting Black students in school and housing around this time period. 
“He worked closely with the community to help them find homes, he was also very active at his church, Bethel AME,” Ballard said. 
 
Postwar period
It wasn’t until 1946 that the first Black students — Quintella King and Ruthe Cash — lived in University Housing in Evans Hall. 
In a research paper written by professor Joy Ann Williamson titled “The Snail-Like Progress of Racial Desegregation at the University of Illinois,” other Black women would follow. 
However, even though the dorms were desegregated by providing female Black students with housing contracts, Black and white women were not allowed to room together, Williamson said. 
Williamson added that discriminatory practices from landlords and prohibitory contracts further limited the housing options available. 
Ballard noted that during the period following World War II, the one exception to living in the north end was fraternities and sororities, many of which owned houses closer to campus. 
Examples of such include fraternities Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi and sorority Delta Sigma Theta, all of which were featured in the 1946 issue of the Illio.  
“The north end …  might have been about a 30-minute walk one way,” Ballard said. “So (Black students) still felt their community wasn’t (as) present as they would have liked.” 
Williamson echoed Ballard on the challenges of living in the north end, noting that “traveling to and from campus by foot meant lost time for study and recreation, while white students could take advantage of both.”
 
Post-1960 
Housing and discrimination continued to be a challenge for Black students, even as the Black student population grew in the late 1960’s with Project 500 — an effort to bring in diverse students and offer equal educational opportunities in 1968.  
According to the University Archives, Project 500 consisted of mostly Black and Latino students. 
Ballard said that the influx of Black students in 1968 aided the Black Power movement led by the Black Student Association.  
“The Black Student Association on campus …  (pushed) a lot of things forward with the Black Power movement because they were organizing in 1967,” Ballard said. “When you start to get more black students by 1968, that really made a difference, because there were more voices.”
However, she points out that issues arose when the administration did not fulfill many of the promises that they had made students in the Project 500 program. 
“There were some students who were promised certain things by recruiters, such as certain financial aid packages that didn’t go through,” Ballard noted. “There were some students who were sleeping in lounges.”
Project 500 students eventually organized a sit-in in hopes that the administration would address their frustrations. 
“These students (are) trying to have the same accommodations as other students, and it’s not happening, which led to the big sit-in in 1968,” Ballard said. “They had a list of demands that they hoped Chancellor Peltason would meet with them about.”
Ballard said that the event was peaceful, with people sitting and playing cards whilst waiting for the chancellor to meet with them. 
“The response was that early in the morning, the police came with dogs and there were over 200 students that were arrested,” Ballard said. 
Eventually, though, Chancellor Peltason conceded to some of the demands of students. 
“Chancellor Peltason did concede … (to) having a Black Cultural Center,” Ballard said. “Black Studies also started to emerge, the Black chorus as well … so it really was a movement that brought a lot of programs that are still highly valued today.”

The Marching Illini are preparing to return to the State Farm Center on Oct. 8 after a decade of absence from the Center’s floor. Their last performance was in 2013.
“The Marching Illini ‘Live in Concert’ will be a culmination of season highlights, traditional favorites and some audience surprises along the way,” said Barry Houser, director of the Marching Illini. “The soundtrack of the Fighting Illini will come inside the fantastic State Farm Center for this spectacular concert of lights, music and true Illini Spirit.”
The Marching Illini was coined as the “world’s greatest band” by John Philip Sousa, songwriter of the U.S. national march song “Stars and Stripes Forever, ” according to the band’s About Us page. 
The band has received numerous awards since their conception in 1867, including the Louis Sudler Intercollegiate Marching Band Trophy in 1983, being the second recipient in history of the trophy.
The band has also traveled internationally, with return concerts to Irelandand touching down as the first college band to perform in the U.K.’s London Military Tattoo concert at Wembley Arena in 2001.

Currently, the Marching Illini is composed of 375 undergraduate and graduate student members, spanning musicians, guards and staff members, with a wide range of majors represented in the band, according to the Marching Illini Website.
“I attended the University of Illinois for graduate studies as one of the first grad students studying instrumental conducting,” Houser said. “The opportunity to come back to Illinois was presented, I … have not looked back since. I get to work with some of the most creative and talented students on the planet.”
Tickets for the concert are open now. A 30-minute preshow is available to purchase as well, with opportunities to interact with and receive photographs from band members included.

By Jessie Wang, Assistant News Editor June 16, 2023
Although going to college often leads to a host of memories — new friends, opportunities and career paths — it’s important to stay vigilant. The Daily Illini has created a guide to the many safety resources available on campus. 
 
University of Illinois Police Department
The University of Illinois rests between two cities: Champaign and Urbana. The University of Illinois Police Department, part of the University’s Division of Public Safety, has jurisdiction over campus. Last April, UIPD officially adopted jurisdiction over Campustown. 
According to Pat Wade, senior spokesperson of the department, the UIPD is tailored to the needs of a college campus and operates year round. The UIPD is also fully accredited and provides patrol services, emergency response and investigative resources.

Furthermore, the Community Outreach and Support Team provides educational and community programming, including therapy dogs for campus events. 
Within COAST, the Response, Evaluation and Crisis Help initiative pairs mental health professionals with police officers, providing a co-response model to mental health-related emergencies, Wade said. 
In addition, because forceful sexual offenses are the most common crimes to be reported on college campuses according to the National Center for Educational Statistics in 2019, UIPD specially trains detectives in the Investigation Unit to support survivors of sexual assault. 
“The mission of the University of Illinois Division of Public Safety is to promote a safe and secure environment where education, research and public service can flourish,” Wade said. “When crime does happen, it is our goal to identify and apprehend offenders as quickly as possible.”
 
Illini-Alert
The Illini-Alert is a system where emails and text messages are sent to the campus community when incidents that present an anticipated threat to life, health or safety occur. All campus members automatically receive Illini-Alerts to their Illinois email accounts.
Anyone can opt into Illini-Alert text messages by texting “IlliniAlert” to 226787. 
 
SafeWalks 
Because criminals are more likely to target individuals who are alone at night, the UIPD offers SafeWalks to University students, faculty and staff. Through the SafeWalks program, Student Patrol officers escort the caller to their destination. The UIPD also recommends that students stay together in groups to reduce the risk of being targeted. 
SafeWalks operates from 9 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Sunday to Wednesday, and 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday. SafeWalks escort can be requested by calling 217-222-1216. 
 
Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District SafeRides
SafeRides, offered by MTD, is a service meant for people traveling alone, or in very small groups, late at night to destinations not on a fixed route bus service, according to Amy Snyder, chief of staff at MTD. 
Those interested in requesting a SafeRide may do it via the app or call 218-384-8188. If the trip qualifies under the parameters — the place of origin and destination — then they will get approved. 
“(If) your origin and destination is already on a bus route, we’re going to have you take the bus, because we want to get to people who are in isolated locations as quickly as we can,” Snyder said. 
Snyder cites Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays as the highest volume days and said that wait times on those respective days may last from 30 to 60 minutes.
“SafeRides are not fast rides … this isn’t Uber or Lyft, where you just pop in the queue,” Snyder said. “SafeRides is for people who are kind of out on the fringes.”

UIPD General Safety Tips
 	Trust your instincts. If a situation or location is making you uncomfortable, leave immediately and seek people and places with lights, if possible. 
 	Lock your doors, even if you are in the room. In order to prevent theft, one of the most common crimes to occur on campuses, the best thing individuals can do is to secure their belongings and their residences. 
 	Be aware of your surroundings. Music or phone usage may distract from nearby vehicles or people. 
 	Watch out for scams. College students, especially international college students, are often targeted online or by phone. Scammers often know background information about their targets and appear legitimate. Stay alert and watch out for red flags.

--- Content from https://dailyillini.com/news-stories/champaign-urbana/2023/10/05/champaign-city-council-budget-drainge-improvement/ ---

On Tuesday, the Champaign City Council met at 102 N. Neil St. to discuss budget increases for city employees and public works projects, among other things. Most notably, the increased funding will facilitate phase two of the Garden Hills Drainage Improvement project.
The meeting began at 7 p.m. with the Champaign Township Board voting unanimously to pass ordinances increasing the township’s budget. 
An Illinois Department of Human Services grant of $238,500 will provide Strides Shelter with an administrative assistant, professional development and utilities, according to Township Supervisor Andrew Quarnstrom. 
Employees who receive comparable insurance from a spouse or another entity will receive a $200 health insurance waiver, Quarnstrom said. 
Following the town board meeting, Champaign Mayor Deborah Feinen began the city council meeting by calling for the approval of five budget bills. 

The city council unanimously voted to increase the 2022-23 annual budget and the staffing budget for 2023-24. The council also unanimously voted to increase the budget for employees of the Champaign Public Library for the 2023-24 fiscal year.
The most anticipated item was the budget increase for the Garden Hills Drainage Improvement project. Garden Hills has struggled with flooding for the past few years and phase two of the project will build a drainage basin for the neighborhood.
Feinen thanked all those involved with the project.
“I want to thank ARPA funding from the federal government and the county board,” she said. “The hedge park, new facilities and programming will be a great benefit to our community.”

For the second year in a row, home sales in Champaign County have fallen in the month of August, according to the Champaign County Association of REALTORS. 
PJ Trautman, the immediate past president of CCAR, said the decrease in home sales is in part due to the level of home inventory in the county.
“We saw a 15% decrease in the number of homes sold in our area,” Trautman said. “A lot of that is attributed to the fact that we just don’t have a lot of listings on the market; not a lot of people are currently selling their homes.”
Many homeowners are reluctant to list their homes because of the current market’s high interest rates, Trautman explained.
“We have a lot of homeowners who are locked in very appealing low interest rates,” Trautman said. “If they were to list and sell their homes … and buy a new home, it’s likely that those interest rates for their new loan would be significantly higher.”

Shihan Xie, professor in LAS, elaborated on the market’s current macroeconomic conditions. 
Xie said that during the pandemic there was a surge in housing prices across the country. The Federal Reserve also increased interest rates to combat high inflation last year. 
“This tightening, meaning the raising of interest rates, had a very large impact on the housing market,” Xie said. “We do see … the growth of the housing prices has slowed down nationally since the recent hikes of interest rates.”
These higher interest rates correlate to higher mortgage rates, and the increase in mortgage rates makes borrowing costs more expensive, Xie said. 
Thus, the current conditions make it hard for buyers to enter the real estate market, and combined with finite inventory in the Champaign marketplace, home prices have increased in the county. 
“Some areas are seeing as much as a 20% increase year over year in their property values just because of the limited inventory and the basic principles of supply and demand,” Trautman said. 
However, Xie said economists believe the interest rate will eventually stabilize, making mortgages more affordable than they are now. 
In the case of housing inventory, the development of new homes has faced challenges due to supply chain issues, which arose from the pandemic. 
“There are some new developments in terms of single-family residences (in the county), but not as much as what we would have seen years ago,” Trautman said. 
Trautman noted the Champaign real estate market is perhaps more resilient than other communities due to the employment opportunities.
“We have a lot of transient population with people coming and going all the time … the University and Carle are big employers here in the community,” Trautman said. “So the Champaign-Urbana real estate market is far superior than what the national averages might look like.”

The City of Urbana was awarded a $247,918 grant from the Illinois Department of Human Services, per a press release on Monday. The funds will cover the costs of food, legal expenses and other services for asylum seekers in Champaign County.
“Asylum seekers are commonly forced to flee their countries with little support and resources when they arrive in the United States,” said Janel Gomez, City of Champaign community relations manager and compliance officer. “The grant funds will be used to help support those individuals and families who immigrated to Champaign County in search of a better life.”
The grant period spans from July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024. These funds will support approximately 200 adults and 100 children seeking asylum from Central and South America and the Middle East who have settled in Champaign County since 2022.
According to the release, “Champaign-Urbana is the only downstate community to receive funding through the state’s Supporting Municipalities for Asylum Seeker Services grant opportunity.” 
The grant will be distributed to local services that provide direct aid to asylum seekers such as the Refugee Center, New American Welcome Center and Cunningham Township. 

Both the cities of Urbana and Champaign will supervise and review acceptance of the fund later this fall.
“The City of Urbana is honored to be able to support the important work of our local immigrant service providers, and this funding opportunity will assist many asylum seekers that have come to Illinois looking for a better life,” said Breaden Belcher, interim grants division manager for the City of Urbana.

The University released its annual Security and Fire Safety Report in accordance with the Campus Security Policy, Crime Statistics Act and the State of Illinois Campus Security Enhancement Act. 
The report contains reported crime statistics from the previous three years on campus, certain noncampus buildings and property owned or controlled by the University, and public property within or immediately adjacent from the campus. 
“These are the crimes that have been reported to the University Police Department by victims who have filed a report, by Campus Security Authorities who have been made aware of a criminal incident, or by other law enforcement agencies,” the report said. 
The last three years had no reports of manslaughter or murder. Reports of rape and fondling have gone up since 2022. Reports of aggravated assault and burglary have gone down since 2021. Motor vehicle theft has gone up drastically in 2022. 
The statistics for arrest and disciplinary action reveal that in 2022, only six arrests were made for liquor law-related reasons. Drug law arrests have risen within the past three years. In 2022, there were 349 liquor law violations referred for disciplinary action on campus property and five on public property. 

Statistics in accordance with the Violence Against Women Act reveal that there were 34 reports of domestic violence in 2022. The average for the last three years is approximately 29. Stalking reports have gone up in the last three years. 
In 2022, there were hate crimes reported for a bias of race, a religious bias, a gender identity bias and a national origin bias. In 2021 there was one crime report for simple assault with a bias of race and an aggravated assault with a bias of race on public property. 
Some crimes were reported without information on where they took place. “It is not uncommon for a crime to be reported without information about a location,” the report said. 
“The University Police Department makes its best effort to share all relevant information about a crime with the campus community, but some information may not always be available,” the report said.
In 2022 there were five fire reports, which is the lowest number in the last three years. 
“Information about these crimes has been shared in the interest of transparency and so campus community members have the information they need to be responsible for their safety and the safety of others,” the report said.

The Daily Illini • October 1, 2023 • https://dailyillini.com/news-stories/champaign-urbana/2023/10/01/annual-police-report-crime-trends/
The University released its annual Security and Fire Safety Report in accordance with the Campus Security Policy, Crime Statistics Act and the State of Illinois Campus Security Enhancement Act. 
The report contains reported crime statistics from the previous three years on campus, certain noncampus buildings and property owned or controlled by the University, and public property within or immediately adjacent from the campus. 
“These are the crimes that have been reported to the University Police Department by victims who have filed a report, by Campus Security Authorities who have been made aware of a criminal incident, or by other law enforcement agencies,” the report said. 
The last three years had no reports of manslaughter or murder. Reports of rape and fondling have gone up since 2022. Reports of aggravated assault and burglary have gone down since 2021. Motor vehicle theft has gone up drastically in 2022. 
The statistics for arrest and disciplinary action reveal that in 2022, only six arrests were made for liquor law-related reasons. Drug law arrests have risen within the past three years. In 2022, there were 349 liquor law violations referred for disciplinary action on campus property and five on public property. 
Statistics in accordance with the Violence Against Women Act reveal that there were 34 reports of domestic violence in 2022. The average for the last three years is approximately 29. Stalking reports have gone up in the last three years.

The Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District exceeded pre-pandemic ridership numbers for the first time this August, alongside a record-breaking enrollment year for the University. 
The statistic was announced on Wednesday at the MTD Board’s monthly public meeting at 3 p.m. in the Illinois Terminal.
“We’re seeing increases in ridership across all fare types, so I don’t think that’s isolated to the University, but that’s a major contribution,” said Amy Snyder, chief of staff of MTD, between scatterings of applause.
August recorded a total of 779,102 riders compared to August 2019’s 708,465. During the pandemic, 2020’s August ridership reached a low of 266,497.
The University’s enrollment report, which is released on the 10th day of every fall semester, reported its own record-highs for the 2023-24 enrollment period. The number of enrolled applicants (8,325) attending the University broke every other enrollment number since 2014. 

The acceptance rate for the 2023-24 year was the lowest it has been since 2014 as well, with only 43.7% of applicants being admitted.
The board also voted to continue the Eagle Express service for Rantoul with no opposition. The service, which has steadily increased its ridership to 2,000 riders a month since its implementation in 2016, was originally set to end in October. The service has been extended to 2026.
“This, I think, is one of the better services we provide as an agency,” said Phil Fiscilla, member of the board. “There’s a lot of people who live in Rantoul but work or attend Parkland College here in Champaign or vice versa.”
The Village of Rantoul will continue to pay a portion of the cost of the three buses, known as C-CARTS, for the remainder of the service.
The board meeting and its board packet, which includes further statistics on the information disclosed during the meeting, can be found and watched online on the MTD website. 
The next public meeting will be held on Oct. 25 at 3 p.m. at the Illinois Terminal.

The Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District is sending a wheelchair-accessible bus to Ukraine as part of an effort to supply vehicles to wounded soldiers and people with disabilities in areas affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
US Ambulances for Ukraine, an effort by OSF HealthCare, has delivered 67 vehicles to Ukraine since last March.  
By being wheelchair-accessible, this vehicle will be the first of its kind for US Ambulances for Ukraine. The bus will also be the first donation from the Champaign-Urbana area. 
In a press release sent on Tuesday, Chris Manson, vice president of OSF HealthCare, described how the MTD vehicle will benefit the region.
“This vehicle will help move wounded soldiers, especially those with significant injuries who are confined to a wheelchair,” Manson said. “Its capabilities will also allow it to be used in emergency evacuations when Ukrainians with disabilities need to be relocated.”

Karl Gnadt, managing director of MTD, expressed his gratitude for the partnership with OSF and US Ambulances for Ukraine.
“Donating this vehicle, which met the federal requirements of a useful life, gives our community the opportunity to share accessible transport with those who need it most,” Gnadt said.

On Tuesday at 7 p.m., the city of Urbana held its regular City Council meeting at 400 S. Vine St. The City Council meeting was also livestreamed via YouTube for viewers who could not go to the meeting in person. 
There was a Mayoral Proclamation for Urbana’s Pride Week describing the rich LGBTQ+ history of representation. Uniting Pride of Champaign County, a community center founded in 2009, was described as an organization to advocate for the equality and visibility of the LGBTQ+ community. 
“And whereas since 1972 the cities of Champagne and Urbana have been at the forefront,” the Mayoral Proclamation stated, of “protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals by prohibiting the discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.”
Champaign-Urbana’s annual Pride Fest began on Sept. 23 and will be held through this Sunday. Events will be hosted throughout the community offering opportunities to learn about and support the LGBTQ+ community. 
As an update of the Mayor/Council Strategic Goals, there was a draft staffing report for the police and fire departments supporting housing, security and equity. 

“Specifically, the action step is to coordinate with housing and social services agencies to reduce homelessness,” the Mayoral Proclamation stated.
The plan aims to increase housing, improve data utilization, enhance equity, improve landlord engagement and increase lived experience representation. The plan will be presented to the council before the end of the year. The Homeless Services Summit will also be held next week on Tuesday, during which the council will vote on the plan and bring funds together.
The Light Asset Management Plan is expected to be in motion. The plan aims to convert traffic lights and streetlights to better energy-efficient technology and change them to the same aesthetic throughout the city. 
“We do not use LED, which is very uncommon at this point,” said Mayor Diane Marlin. “And then the other thing is we have, I think, a dozen different styles of streetlights.” 
An ordinance amending the Urbana zoning map was approved by all City Council members. 
An ordinance approving a final subdivision plat was up for approval. The ordinance regarded the restrictions and powers of homeowners associations and the way they may affect individuals.
“If there is an HOA out there that is doing something against state law, they should be aware that they’re in violation,” said James Quisenberry, member of the City Council. “They can be challenged, and they should be.”
The ordinance approving a final subdivision plat was passed by all City Council members.
An ordinance revising the annual budget was up for approval this meeting. The ordinance regarded how the city plans to use a grant, and whether the money should be used to rebuild fire stations or be used in a way to reach citizens more directly.
“This was an opportunity to build these buildings with support from the state, and I think that’s appropriate and I’m going to support it,” Quisenberry said.
The ordinance was passed to rebuild Urbana’s fire stations.

The Champaign Public Library Board of Trustees met on Wednesday to discuss the opening of the Studio and upcoming events. 
The meeting began with the director’s report about the Studio, a new 8,000-foot space in the basement of the library. 
The Studio will host a weekend open house on Oct. 7 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Oct. 8 from noon to 6 p.m. Open weekends for the Studio begin on Oct. 14. 
The Studio has a variety of tools and software, such as a laser cutter and large-scale printer. “We also have a gaming area and some high-tech sewing machines,” said Tricia Duzan, deputy director of the Champaign Public Library. 
Duzan said the flexibility of the space could potentially provide many uses for the community. 

“I think that’s going to be a really nice way for people to get involved and learn new skills, maybe … they want to start their own business,” Duzan said. 
The director’s report also included updates about the Douglass Branch Library and the visit of several authors in the month of October. 
In 2020, the Champaign Public Library was ranked in the top 4.67% of public libraries nationwide. Duzan emphasized the role of the library staff and the community in contributing to the ranking. 
“Our staff does a really wonderful job understanding what (the community’s) needs are and trying to service that,” Duzan said. “Our community is just huge supporters of the library in every single way.”

This morning, Urbana police took into custody the shooter of an attempted murder that occurred on Friday on Dublin Street. No injuries or casualties were recorded.
At approximately 12:16 p.m. on Friday, Urbana police were dispatched to the 1400 block of Dublin Street after reports of a shooting.
According to a press release by the Urbana Police Department, several people emerged from a church that also held a funeral. They walked onto the sidewalk of Dublin Street in the middle of an argument.
29-year-old Champaign man Linnell Blount, one of the several in the group, began firing several shots from a handgun after one of the involved people started running away. 
None of the shots struck anybody, but they left bullet impacts in a residential building on the 600 block of East Columbia Avenue. Nobody who was inside the home was injured.

Urbana police did not initially find the offender at the scene. They were able to identify Blount as the shooter with help from the community. 
Police obtained an arrest warrant for Blount on the charge of attempted murder, alongside a $2 million dollar bond.
According to the press release, at around 9 a.m. Monday, “an astute Champaign County Court Security Officer recognized Blount at the Champaign County Courthouse where Blount was attending a status hearing on an unrelated case.”
Blount was taken in and transported to the Champaign County Satellite Jail without incident.
Urbana police continue to ask the public for additional footage and information of the incident through the Crime Stoppers tip program by phone at 217-373-8477/TIPS, through the website at 373tips.com or through the P3 Tips mobile app. The program ensures all tippers remain completely anonymous regardless of method.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth visited Research Park on Friday to participate in a fireside chat panel on innovation. 
The event began with statements from Vice Chancellor and Provost John Coleman and Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation Susan Martinis.
Friday afternoon’s event focused on the Grainger College of Engineering and the Research Park in their roles as contributors to the global economy, as well as their support of Duckworth’s efforts in the Senate.
Duckworth repeatedly highlighted the importance of the University’s contributions to global tech and commerce, stating that she always recommends Research Park to technology executives seeking to relocate their headquarters.
“‘We need engineers,’ they said,” the senator explained. “Well, I know a place where we graduate more engineers than MIT, CalTech and Stanford. Come to Champaign and you’re going to see we’ve the resources.”

Duckworth explained that many executives of influential technology companies are alumni of the University and other Illinois schools.
“That is what the research universities do,” Duckworth said. “You are providing the workforce, but then you’re also incubating all of this innovation that is happening.”
The senator sat on the panel with assistant professor Shaloo Rakheja and Dean Rashid Bashir, both of whom discussed tangible work being done by researchers at the University.
Bashir said that the University intends to attract the strongest talent from around the world and prepare them for a changing tech industry.
“I think we have such an opportunity to be able to do all things … to be the best place in the world to attract the best people,” Bashir said. “I think this issue of retraining is so important — that is just really going to be critical to the future.”
According to Bashir, the discipline of engineering has a lot to learn from studies ranging from biology to the social sciences.
“There is so much possibility to use your skills, to use what you’re learning to really make an impact on the world — think big.”
Rakheja said that a new minor in superconductor engineering is a unique program that will enable students from across the student body to study engineering from a more holistic perspective.
“(Companies) are chiefly excited about the … minor program,” Rakheja said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the first one, but it’s probably one of the most unique ones.”
Rakheja explained that the college is making an effort to integrate different kinds of study into engineering coursework so that members of the student body are prepared to work in a new world with emerging technologies.
“Students come in and take a major, they take a minor — and all of these disciplines have very strict knowledge,” Rakheja explained. “New technology is very complex, so what our companies really want is to be able to train students in the process of (engineering) without traditional boundaries.” 
Duckworth echoed Rakheja’s sentiment, saying that larger corporations are seeking students with a wide variety of skills.
“Blur your boundaries,” Duckworth said. “That is where you’re going to be the most productive and that is where you’re going to be able to market yourself the best.”

The senator sat on the panel with assistant professor Shaloo Rakheja and Dean Rashid Bashir, both of whom discussed tangible work being done by researchers at the University.
Bashir said that the University intends to attract the strongest talent from around the world and prepare them for a changing tech industry.
“I think we have such an opportunity to be able to do all things … to be the best place in the world to attract the best people,” Bashir said. “I think this issue of retraining is so important — that is just really going to be critical to the future.”
According to Bashir, the discipline of engineering has a lot to learn from studies ranging from biology to the social sciences.
“There is so much possibility to use your skills, to use what you’re learning to really make an impact on the world — think big.”
Rakheja said that a new minor in superconductor engineering is a unique program that will enable students from across the student body to study engineering from a more holistic perspective.
“(Companies) are chiefly excited about the … minor program,” Rakheja said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the first one, but it’s probably one of the most unique ones.”
Rakheja explained that the college is making an effort to integrate different kinds of study into engineering coursework so that members of the student body are prepared to work in a new world with emerging technologies.
“Students come in and take a major, they take a minor — and all of these disciplines have very strict knowledge,” Rakheja explained. “New technology is very complex, so what our companies really want is to be able to train students in the process of (engineering) without traditional boundaries.” 
Duckworth echoed Rakheja’s sentiment, saying that larger corporations are seeking students with a wide variety of skills.
“Blur your boundaries,” Duckworth said. “That is where you’re going to be the most productive and that is where you’re going to be able to market yourself the best.”

Sen. Tammy Duckworth visited Research Park on Friday to participate in a fireside chat panel on innovation. 
The event began with statements from Vice Chancellor and Provost John Coleman and Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation Susan Martinis.
Friday afternoon’s event focused on the Grainger College of Engineering and the Research Park in their roles as contributors to the global economy, as well as their support of Duckworth’s efforts in the Senate.
Duckworth repeatedly highlighted the importance of the University’s contributions to global tech and commerce, stating that she always recommends Research Park to technology executives seeking to relocate their headquarters.
“‘We need engineers,’ they said,” the senator explained. “Well, I know a place where we graduate more engineers than MIT, CalTech and Stanford. Come to Champaign and you’re going to see we’ve the resources.”
Duckworth explained that many executives of influential technology companies are alumni of the University and other Illinois schools.
“That is what the research universities do,” Duckworth said. “You are providing the workforce, but then you’re also incubating all of this innovation that is happening.”

Scheduled to start on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., State Farm Center’s “Thursday Night Live” was canceled at around 8 p.m. 
The show would have featured Colin Jost, a head writer at “Saturday Night Live.” Andrew Dismukes and Marcello Hernandez would have opened the event. 
The announcement came from the center’s speakers, who said the event would be postponed due to an “unexpected weather-related air-travel disruption” that affected all three performers. Ticket holders were told they would receive updates via email or online at statefarmcenter.com/colinjost.
A single boo came out from the crowd after the announcement.
“I was really stoked for this, and now it’s kind of disappointing because I just sat here for an hour,” said Krescene Holscher, junior in ACES.

Holscher said one of her favorite parts of “Saturday Night Live” is a satirical news program called “Weekend Update,” which Colin Jost has co-hosted since 2014.
“As soon as everyone stood up and left, I was waiting for the punchline,” Holscher said. “It has to be a joke, right?”
Alyssa Ramir, graduate student studying veterinary medicine, came to see the show with her friends.
“We were all very upset that Colin Jost couldn’t make it tonight,” Ramir said. “We all bonded over Colin Jost and SNL in undergrad.”
Emma Baker, a University alum, came to Champaign-Urbana to visit Ramir and her other friends for the weekend. She currently lives in Cary, Illinois, a three-hour drive from the University.
“We were just thinking (Colin Jost) was taking a long time, thought he would come on eventually, maybe one of the openers was just missing,” Baker said. “We did not expect this.”
UPDATE: 
In an update posted to their website on Monday, State Farm Center said there are no current plans for “Thursday Night Live” to be rescheduled. Refunds will be issued to the original form of payment for all tickets and prepaid parking, the site said.

Dubbed the world’s “oldest planned surgical procedure” by 20th century anthropologist Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, circumcision’s roots can be traced to religious and cultural traditions dating back millennia.
Circumcision is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of all or part of the foreskin of a penis. 
The foreskin, a sheath of retractable loose skin surrounding the tip of a penis, is surgically removed from the majority of baby boys born in the United States. Up to 80% of men between the ages of 18 and 59 are circumcised in the United States, compared to around 38% of men worldwide.
Today the most prominent groups who perform ritual circumcisions are followers of Abrahamic religions, namely Islam and Judaism. 
Roots in religion 

“(Circumcision) is a very interesting ceremony,” said Thom Lobe, a pediatric surgeon at the University of Illinois Hospital and Clinics. “It is probably the oldest ceremony that we do in Judaism.”
Lobe specializes in the use of minimally invasive surgery to treat neonatal cancer and has contributed to the development of new laser therapies for the treatment of disease.
The surgeon is also a prominent Chicagoland mohel, or “mohala” in Aramaic. A mohel is a practicing Jew trained to perform ritual circumcisions.
Ritual circumcision is a requirement outlined in the Torah, the central religious text of Judaism consisting of the first five books in the Hebrew Bible.
In the 17th chapter of the Book of Bereshit, the Hebrew title for the Book of Genesis, God appeared to Abraham — who is often described as the founding father of Judaism — with the intention of establishing an enduring covenant with him.
In exchange for fertility, land, power and “a multitude of nations,” God asked 99-year-old Abraham to circumcise the foreskin of his penis and commit to circumcising all of his descendants.
Dr. Lobe said that the ritual of circumcision is traditionally observed on the eighth day of an infant boy’s life and never earlier.
According to an interpretation of Bereshit written by Rabbi Matthew Berkowitz, a faculty member at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Jerusalem, there is a specific reason for this scriptural requirement. 
It is written in the Torah that on the eighth day of the earth’s creation, God invited humankind to join him in the design of the world. This timeline, according to Berkowitz, is why circumcision, humankind’s contribution to the body, is required to take place after the eighth day of life. In other words, the eight-day minimum is rooted in the idea that the body, like the earth, is the product of both God and man.
The Jewish ceremony of circumcision, or a “bris,” is traditionally performed by a mohel in a synagogue with input from a rabbi and the child’s family. 
“For me, it’s always an emotional thing,” Lobe said. “I get very involved, and it’s meaningful to be able to participate with the families. For some Jewish families who don’t practice the religion but have a male child, it may be the only Jewish thing they do in their lives.” 
In the process of continuing the millennia-old tradition, Lobe underwent a 12-week course from the National Organization of American Mohalim, a reform Jewish organization tasked with mohel training and education. 
According to Lobe, the course highlighted the importance of inclusivity and understanding in cases where parents are members of the LGBTQ+ community, interfaith or otherwise nontraditional.
Along with Jewish ritual circumcisions, Lobe has performed many secular circumcisions in a hospital setting, listing social norms, aesthetics and hygiene-related benefits as some of the reasons that a nonreligious family may choose to circumcise their son.
Lobe said that circumcision is completely optional in most cases and that the decision not to have the procedure done does not make a Jewish person any less Jewish.
“It’s really in the perception of the family — the belief is that there’s no penalty if you don’t get circumcised,” Lobe said. “There are some reform rabbis who think ‘Yes, while we understand the historical significance, we shouldn’t be doing this to babies without their consent.’”
“Intactivism”
In recent years, dialogues surrounding the ancient surgical practice have inspired a surge in self-proclaimed “intactivists,” or activists who believe infant circumcision is a human rights violation.
Intact America is a national organization that advocates against the circumcision of those who are unable to provide consent, especially those who cannot consent on account of their age.
The Daily Illini spoke with Georganne Chapin, founding executive director of Intact America and former health care executive, to gain insight into the organization’s mission.
“Intact America grew out of a movement that has really been rolling since the 1970s — there were a number of grassroots organizations that had been advocating against routine cutting of baby boys, but we needed a new organization,” Chapin said. “We had a donor, and at the end of a year-long process … he offered to fund the startup of (Intact) in late 2008.” 
Chapin said that for many people, the debate over circumcision is one that causes feelings of discomfort or shame.
“A lot of people don’t want to talk about it, especially if they have been cut or if they’ve agreed to have their child cut or if they’ve actually cut somebody’s foreskin off,” Chapin said. “Doctors — they don’t want to think about it or talk about it.”
According to Chapin, the organization has been successful so far in promoting its mission and reducing the stigma surrounding dialogues about circumcision. 
“When we started, it was a conversation that people couldn’t wait to shut down or, you know, they start looking for the exit, right?” Chapin said. “It made people very uncomfortable. We’ve done a lot of research, and I think our main contribution is that we have made this a topic of mainstream conversation.”
One program conceived by Intact America in an effort to destigmatize the conversation surrounding foreskin was the inaugural Foreskin Festival livestream on April 4, a date the organization hopes will become an annual holiday called “Foreskin Day.” 
Robin LaVerne Wilson, an activist, poet, storyteller, artist and 2016 U.S. Senate candidate from New York, known to their audience as Dragonfly, served as the host of the event, beginning the livestream with a triumphant mantra.
“We’re here to change hearts and minds — one phallus at a time,” Wilson said, beaming.
“I am a multidisciplinary performance artist, and I do work that is in the intersections of art, activism, advocacy and education,” Wilson said in an interview with The DI. “The task came to curate this festival, and it really inspired some really serious, in-depth personal introspection as well as conversations with people in my community about the full extent of what bodily autonomy means.”
Wilson said their experience as a member of the Black community has informed their decision to support the intactivist movement.
“As someone who is very hypersensitive and conscious of how medical apartheid is used in my community, there is an actual circumcision industrial complex at play in this country that benefits from willful ignorance,” Wilson said.
Chapin said that the prominence of infant circumcision in the U.S. can be partially attributed to coercion of mothers in hospitals.
“We did a survey a couple of years ago and found that the average number of times a woman is asked in the perinatal period to sign a consent form for a circumcision is 8.4 — and even more for Black women and Latina women,” Chapin said. “If parents wanted it, they wouldn’t have to be asked (eight) times. It’s a sales job.”
According to Chapin, the assertion that foreskin removal is linked to lessened HIV/AIDS risk is based almost entirely on studies in sub-Saharan Africa with “imperialist” intentions.
“These studies are going to go down in history as a travesty, as medical imperialism and as having stolen body parts from Black men, African men who were not given formal consent, who were given money to be circumcised,” Chapin said. “Those so-called ‘studies’ in Africa were circumcision projects. They were not really well-designed, ethically designed research studies. If you look at the studies — that 60% rate that’s trotted out — that is a relative statistic.”
The studies
The 60% figure that Chapin referenced likely arose from a seminal 2007 research paper written about the connection between circumcision and HIV transmission entitled “Male circumcision for HIV prevention in young men in Kisumu, Kenya.”
The study was designed by Robert Bailey, a professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and public health and former adviser to entities including the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Republic of Kenya’s Ministry of Health. The study presented the findings of a randomized trial designed to determine whether knowledge of the decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections among circumcised men in Kenya would contribute to unsafe sexual behaviors and thereby greater incidence of HIV, a phenomenon known as risk compensation.
Bailey’s research found that circumcision had a protective effect of 60% against HIV transmission in the intervention group over two years. In other words, the study found that circumcision was able to decrease the risk of transmitting HIV by 60% within the sample. 
In an interview with The Daily Illini, Bailey discussed the influential study and his work in the sphere of HIV/AIDS prevention.
“A provincial medical office in western Kenya heard about my work,” Bailey said. “(They) said, ‘Can you come here? We’re in an area with the highest HIV rates in all of East Africa and men here do not circumcise, whereas people all around us do circumcise and their HIV rates are about a quarter of what ours are.’”  
Upon receiving the invitation to Kisumu, a city in Kenya, Bailey designed a randomized trial consisting of 2,800 uncircumcised men who indicated that they were interested in having the procedure done for the study.
“So, I went to Kisumu and did a preliminary study to see what the level of knowledge about circumcision and HIV was and whether or not men would ever accept to be circumcised in a traditionally noncircumcising community,” Bailey said. “I found that actually a lot of the men, about 65%, said they would get circumcised.”
According to Bailey, the project underwent rigorous ethical protocols. Its purpose was not to promote infant circumcision in the U.S., but rather to demonstrate the harm reductive effect that elective circumcision can have in an area where HIV transmission rates are already high.
“We spend a lot of time counseling and telling young men the risks and the benefits of circumcision — we’re not doing infant circumcision,” Bailey said. “We do adolescent and adult male circumcision, where the young men are fully informed and they’re capable of asking questions and doubts. It’s fully voluntary — there’s nothing coercive about it. They volunteer, they’re not paid and they’re informed about the risks and benefits of circumcision.”
According to Bailey, the trial’s design accounted for many confounding variables by being completely random.
“We recruited almost 2,800 young men between the ages of 18 and 24 and asked them if they would be willing to be circumcised,” Bailey said. “Those that consented were randomly assigned to be circumcised right away or to remain uncircumcised for two years. That random selection is the way you get around possible confounding variables, you know, like sexual behavior, age or cultural beliefs or anything.”
Bailey identified the study as his most widely influential project and explained that it has contributed to an improvement in circumcision accessibility in areas where the procedure has the potential to make significant differences in HIV risk.
“We’ve now done 28 million circumcisions of young men in 13 different countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and that all really comes from our trial in Kisumu and two other trials — one in Uganda and one in South Africa,” Bailey said. “These are the seminal studies that have nailed down the protective effect of circumcision and caused the (World Health Organization) in early 2008 to declare that … in areas where most men are not circumcised and HIV rates are high, we should scale up male circumcision.”
When asked for his response to criticisms of the study’s intentions, Bailey said that the qualms are often misguided and that he has his own ethical reservations concerning infant circumcision. 
“The benefit of adolescent circumcision is that at least you can get informed assent from an adolescent,” Bailey said. “My major misgiving about infant circumcision is — I think there are a lot of benefits to circumcision — but when you’re permanently altering someone without their consent, I think that raises ethical questions. If people accepted adolescent circumcision here as they do in Africa, in many ways, that would make more sense.”
Bailey added that his study’s results are not as relevant to HIV risk in the Western world as they are in sub-Saharan Africa. He explained that the most common means of HIV transmission in the United States and Europe are sex between men and intravenous drug use — both cases where circumcision does not have a substantial impact on HIV transmission.
In sub-Saharan Africa, where the most common means of HIV transmission is sex between men and women, circumcision has a far greater impact.
“In Europe and the United States, most HIV infections are actually due to receptive anal intercourse and injecting drug use,” Bailey said. “In those two situations, male circumcision is going to have minimal or no impact at all on HIV. So purely for prevention of HIV, advocating for male circumcision in Europe and the United States would not be effective.”
Bailey said that for men in the U.S., there are numerous benefits to getting circumcised, but he wouldn’t identify HIV prevention as a primary motivation for the procedure. In fact, Bailey said that the decision to circumcise often has nothing to do with religion or health.
“The benefits of circumcision in general are a lower risk of genital ulcer disease, lower risk of human papillomavirus, which can cause penile cancer and cervical cancer in the female partners,” Bailey said. “However, in many cases, giving a good explanation of the risks and the benefits (to parents) almost falls on deaf ears, because they usually have made the decision themselves. … (Parents make) the decision based on their culture and whether the father was circumcised.”
According to Bailey, the procedure has over a century of history in the U.S.
“It started in the First World War,” Bailey said. “A lot of men were circumcised during the war because they were getting infections of the foreskin, and then in the Second World War, it had escalated even more.” 
The anthropologist then said that the procedure became routine over the decades following World War II. 
“In the 1960s, infant circumcision was routine,” Bailey said. “I mean, literally, the baby would just be taken away, put in another room, circumcised and then brought back to the mother without even asking. But, in 1970, there was an ethical review and the Academy of Pediatrics said that infant circumcision should not be routine and that parents should be informed.”
Bailey says that he agreed with the Academy’s decision, stating that the option to circumcise a child should be presented to parents in the hospital, but it should include a detailed description of both benefits and drawbacks to the procedure.
“A sober and objective and realistic explanation of both the costs and the benefits of infant circumcision should be offered to parents,” Bailey said. “They should (be able to) make an informed decision about whether or not to have their infant circumcised.”

In an interview with The Daily Illini, Bailey discussed the influential study and his work in the sphere of HIV/AIDS prevention.
“A provincial medical office in western Kenya heard about my work,” Bailey said. “(They) said, ‘Can you come here? We’re in an area with the highest HIV rates in all of East Africa and men here do not circumcise, whereas people all around us do circumcise and their HIV rates are about a quarter of what ours are.’”  
Upon receiving the invitation to Kisumu, a city in Kenya, Bailey designed a randomized trial consisting of 2,800 uncircumcised men who indicated that they were interested in having the procedure done for the study.
“So, I went to Kisumu and did a preliminary study to see what the level of knowledge about circumcision and HIV was and whether or not men would ever accept to be circumcised in a traditionally noncircumcising community,” Bailey said. “I found that actually a lot of the men, about 65%, said they would get circumcised.”
According to Bailey, the project underwent rigorous ethical protocols. Its purpose was not to promote infant circumcision in the U.S., but rather to demonstrate the harm reductive effect that elective circumcision can have in an area where HIV transmission rates are already high.
“We spend a lot of time counseling and telling young men the risks and the benefits of circumcision — we’re not doing infant circumcision,” Bailey said. “We do adolescent and adult male circumcision, where the young men are fully informed and they’re capable of asking questions and doubts. It’s fully voluntary — there’s nothing coercive about it. They volunteer, they’re not paid and they’re informed about the risks and benefits of circumcision.”
According to Bailey, the trial’s design accounted for many confounding variables by being completely random.
“We recruited almost 2,800 young men between the ages of 18 and 24 and asked them if they would be willing to be circumcised,” Bailey said. “Those that consented were randomly assigned to be circumcised right away or to remain uncircumcised for two years. That random selection is the way you get around possible confounding variables, you know, like sexual behavior, age or cultural beliefs or anything.”
Bailey identified the study as his most widely influential project and explained that it has contributed to an improvement in circumcision accessibility in areas where the procedure has the potential to make significant differences in HIV risk.
“We’ve now done 28 million circumcisions of young men in 13 different countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and that all really comes from our trial in Kisumu and two other trials — one in Uganda and one in South Africa,” Bailey said. “These are the seminal studies that have nailed down the protective effect of circumcision and caused the (World Health Organization) in early 2008 to declare that … in areas where most men are not circumcised and HIV rates are high, we should scale up male circumcision.”
When asked for his response to criticisms of the study’s intentions, Bailey said that the qualms are often misguided and that he has his own ethical reservations concerning infant circumcision. 
“The benefit of adolescent circumcision is that at least you can get informed assent from an adolescent,” Bailey said. “My major misgiving about infant circumcision is — I think there are a lot of benefits to circumcision — but when you’re permanently altering someone without their consent, I think that raises ethical questions. If people accepted adolescent circumcision here as they do in Africa, in many ways, that would make more sense.”
Bailey added that his study’s results are not as relevant to HIV risk in the Western world as they are in sub-Saharan Africa. He explained that the most common means of HIV transmission in the United States and Europe are sex between men and intravenous drug use — both cases where circumcision does not have a substantial impact on HIV transmission.
In sub-Saharan Africa, where the most common means of HIV transmission is sex between men and women, circumcision has a far greater impact.
“In Europe and the United States, most HIV infections are actually due to receptive anal intercourse and injecting drug use,” Bailey said. “In those two situations, male circumcision is going to have minimal or no impact at all on HIV. So purely for prevention of HIV, advocating for male circumcision in Europe and the United States would not be effective.”
Bailey said that for men in the U.S., there are numerous benefits to getting circumcised, but he wouldn’t identify HIV prevention as a primary motivation for the procedure. In fact, Bailey said that the decision to circumcise often has nothing to do with religion or health.
“The benefits of circumcision in general are a lower risk of genital ulcer disease, lower risk of human papillomavirus, which can cause penile cancer and cervical cancer in the female partners,” Bailey said. “However, in many cases, giving a good explanation of the risks and the benefits (to parents) almost falls on deaf ears, because they usually have made the decision themselves. … (Parents make) the decision based on their culture and whether the father was circumcised.”
According to Bailey, the procedure has over a century of history in the U.S.
“It started in the First World War,” Bailey said. “A lot of men were circumcised during the war because they were getting infections of the foreskin, and then in the Second World War, it had escalated even more.” 
The anthropologist then said that the procedure became routine over the decades following World War II. 
“In the 1960s, infant circumcision was routine,” Bailey said. “I mean, literally, the baby would just be taken away, put in another room, circumcised and then brought back to the mother without even asking. But, in 1970, there was an ethical review and the Academy of Pediatrics said that infant circumcision should not be routine and that parents should be informed.”
Bailey says that he agreed with the Academy’s decision, stating that the option to circumcise a child should be presented to parents in the hospital, but it should include a detailed description of both benefits and drawbacks to the procedure.
“A sober and objective and realistic explanation of both the costs and the benefits of infant circumcision should be offered to parents,” Bailey said. “They should (be able to) make an informed decision about whether or not to have their infant circumcised.”

The Daily Illini • April 24, 2023 • https://dailyillini.com/news-stories/longform/2023/04/24/uncut-dissecting-circumcision/
Jacob Slabosz
Charlie Anderson, freshman at Parkland College, pulls up a turtleneck in front of a mural off of South Fifth Street.
Dubbed the world’s “oldest planned surgical procedure” by 20th century anthropologist Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, circumcision’s roots can be traced to religious and cultural traditions dating back millennia.
Circumcision is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of all or part of the foreskin of a penis. 
The foreskin, a sheath of retractable loose skin surrounding the tip of a penis, is surgically removed from the majority of baby boys born in the United States. Up to 80% of men between the ages of 18 and 59 are circumcised in the United States, compared to around 38% of men worldwide.
Today the most prominent groups who perform ritual circumcisions are followers of Abrahamic religions, namely Islam and Judaism. 
Roots in religion 
“(Circumcision) is a very interesting ceremony,” said Thom Lobe, a pediatric surgeon at the University of Illinois Hospital and Clinics. “It is probably the oldest ceremony that we do in Judaism.”
Lobe specializes in the use of minimally invasive surgery to treat neonatal cancer and has contributed to the development of new laser therapies for the treatment of disease.
The surgeon is also a prominent Chicagoland mohel, or “mohala” in Aramaic. A mohel is a practicing Jew trained to perform ritual circumcisions.
Ritual circumcision is a requirement outlined in the Torah, the central religious text of Judaism consisting of the first five books in the Hebrew Bible.
In the 17th chapter of the Book of Bereshit, the Hebrew title for the Book of Genesis, God appeared to Abraham — who is often described as the founding father of Judaism — with the intention of establishing an enduring covenant with him.
In exchange for fertility, land, power and “a multitude of nations,” God asked 99-year-old Abraham to circumcise the foreskin of his penis and commit to circumcising all of his descendants.
Dr. Lobe said that the ritual of circumcision is traditionally observed on the eighth day of an infant boy’s life and never earlier.
According to an interpretation of Bereshit written by Rabbi Matthew Berkowitz, a faculty member at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Jerusalem, there is a specific reason for this scriptural requirement. 
It is written in the Torah that on the eighth day of the earth’s creation, God invited humankind to join him in the design of the world. This timeline, according to Berkowitz, is why circumcision, humankind’s contribution to the body, is required to take place after the eighth day of life. In other words, the eight-day minimum is rooted in the idea that the body, like the earth, is the product of both God and man.
The Jewish ceremony of circumcision, or a “bris,” is traditionally performed by a mohel in a synagogue with input from a rabbi and the child’s family. 
“For me, it’s always an emotional thing,” Lobe said. “I get very involved, and it’s meaningful to be able to participate with the families. For some Jewish families who don’t practice the religion but have a male child, it may be the only Jewish thing they do in their lives.” 
In the process of continuing the millennia-old tradition, Lobe underwent a 12-week course from the National Organization of American Mohalim, a reform Jewish organization tasked with mohel training and education. 
According to Lobe, the course highlighted the importance of inclusivity and understanding in cases where parents are members of the LGBTQ+ community, interfaith or otherwise nontraditional.
Along with Jewish ritual circumcisions, Lobe has performed many secular circumcisions in a hospital setting, listing social norms, aesthetics and hygiene-related benefits as some of the reasons that a nonreligious family may choose to circumcise their son.
Lobe said that circumcision is completely optional in most cases and that the decision not to have the procedure done does not make a Jewish person any less Jewish.
“It’s really in the perception of the family — the belief is that there’s no penalty if you don’t get circumcised,” Lobe said. “There are some reform rabbis who think ‘Yes, while we understand the historical significance, we shouldn’t be doing this to babies without their consent.’”
“Intactivism”
In recent years, dialogues surrounding the ancient surgical practice have inspired a surge in self-proclaimed “intactivists,” or activists who believe infant circumcision is a human rights violation.
Intact America is a national organization that advocates against the circumcision of those who are unable to provide consent, especially those who cannot consent on account of their age.
The Daily Illini spoke with Georganne Chapin, founding executive director of Intact America and former health care executive, to gain insight into the organization’s mission.
“Intact America grew out of a movement that has really been rolling since the 1970s — there were a number of grassroots organizations that had been advocating against routine cutting of baby boys, but we needed a new organization,” Chapin said. “We had a donor, and at the end of a year-long process … he offered to fund the startup of (Intact) in late 2008.” 
Chapin said that for many people, the debate over circumcision is one that causes feelings of discomfort or shame.
“A lot of people don’t want to talk about it, especially if they have been cut or if they’ve agreed to have their child cut or if they’ve actually cut somebody’s foreskin off,” Chapin said. “Doctors — they don’t want to think about it or talk about it.”
According to Chapin, the organization has been successful so far in promoting its mission and reducing the stigma surrounding dialogues about circumcision. 
“When we started, it was a conversation that people couldn’t wait to shut down or, you know, they start looking for the exit, right?” Chapin said. “It made people very uncomfortable. We’ve done a lot of research, and I think our main contribution is that we have made this a topic of mainstream conversation.”
One program conceived by Intact America in an effort to destigmatize the conversation surrounding foreskin was the inaugural Foreskin Festival livestream on April 4, a date the organization hopes will become an annual holiday called “Foreskin Day.” 
Robin LaVerne Wilson, an activist, poet, storyteller, artist and 2016 U.S. Senate candidate from New York, known to their audience as Dragonfly, served as the host of the event, beginning the livestream with a triumphant mantra.
“We’re here to change hearts and minds — one phallus at a time,” Wilson said, beaming.
“I am a multidisciplinary performance artist, and I do work that is in the intersections of art, activism, advocacy and education,” Wilson said in an interview with The DI. “The task came to curate this festival, and it really inspired some really serious, in-depth personal introspection as well as conversations with people in my community about the full extent of what bodily autonomy means.”
Wilson said their experience as a member of the Black community has informed their decision to support the intactivist movement.
“As someone who is very hypersensitive and conscious of how medical apartheid is used in my community, there is an actual circumcision industrial complex at play in this country that benefits from willful ignorance,” Wilson said.
Chapin said that the prominence of infant circumcision in the U.S. can be partially attributed to coercion of mothers in hospitals.
“We did a survey a couple of years ago and found that the average number of times a woman is asked in the perinatal period to sign a consent form for a circumcision is 8.4 — and even more for Black women and Latina women,” Chapin said. “If parents wanted it, they wouldn’t have to be asked (eight) times. It’s a sales job.”
According to Chapin, the assertion that foreskin removal is linked to lessened HIV/AIDS risk is based almost entirely on studies in sub-Saharan Africa with “imperialist” intentions.
“These studies are going to go down in history as a travesty, as medical imperialism and as having stolen body parts from Black men, African men who were not given formal consent, who were given money to be circumcised,” Chapin said. “Those so-called ‘studies’ in Africa were circumcision projects. They were not really well-designed, ethically designed research studies. If you look at the studies — that 60% rate that’s trotted out — that is a relative statistic.”
The studies
The 60% figure that Chapin referenced likely arose from a seminal 2007 research paper written about the connection between circumcision and HIV transmission entitled “Male circumcision for HIV prevention in young men in Kisumu, Kenya.”
The study was designed by Robert Bailey, a professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and public health and former adviser to entities including the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Republic of Kenya’s Ministry of Health. The study presented the findings of a randomized trial designed to determine whether knowledge of the decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections among circumcised men in Kenya would contribute to unsafe sexual behaviors and thereby greater incidence of HIV, a phenomenon known as risk compensation.
Bailey’s research found that circumcision had a protective effect of 60% against HIV transmission in the intervention group over two years. In other words, the study found that circumcision was able to decrease the risk of transmitting HIV by 60% within the sample.

On Oct. 6, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh visited the University for a screening of his documentary “What is a Woman.” The same night, the Illinois Student Government posted a statement on its Instagram account. While expressing its support for the LGBTQ+ community as pointing out that Walsh’s claims are hateful, the statement declared that “free speech permits such discussion to occur.”
Students flooded to the Instagram comments, including Soumil Biswas, sophomore in ACES. He argued that the University, which prides itself on the inclusivity of LGBTQ+ individuals, should have prevented Matt Walsh from spreading hate speech against trans people.
“I don’t know if hate speech really consists of free speech, but the hate that was brought to trans people because of this event definitely does not align with the University’s beliefs, so they should not allow that to happen,” Biswas said.
Biswas said he believes ISG should have censored the event. He noted that the student government should represent the voice of the student body, and many in the student body were calling for condemnation.
“The statement ISG put out was very lackluster,” Biswas said. “It was kind of a dumb response because they could just condemn it or just stay silent.”

Four days after the incident, Vindhya Kalipi, junior in LAS, resigned from her position as the vice president of ISG. According to ISG’s announcement, Kalipi resigned over “a fundamental difference of opinion regarding free speech.”
Before Walsh’s arrival, Kalipi talked to administrators and looked through existing laws. She said she understood the Supreme Court has upheld that hate speech is technically protected under free speech. However, Kalipi said she was upset and believed ISG should take a stand and prohibit hate speech.
“We represent students, and we should be listening to what the student body that elected us and believed in us wants,” Kalipi said. “If the administration doesn’t want to do anything about it, at least we should be doing something.”
Kalipi recalled that she was frustrated when she found out she was the only executive member who believed hate speech should be prohibited.
President Garrett Forrest, junior in LAS, said that though he agrees Matt Walsh’s visit was harmful, he believes free speech is the foundation of democracy.
“The price of having free speech — the price of having a society where you don’t have to worry no matter who’s in power of your views being suppressed or you being punished for advocating for something … The price of that is hate speech,” Forrest said.
He mentioned the counter-protest outside Walsh’s discussion.
“When Matt Walsh was here, there was a counter protest outside there, highlighting the beautiful diversity of the LGBTQ+ community,” Forrest said. “I think it’s on those of us who are opposed to hate speech, who are opposed to the ideas being spread by people like Matt Walsh, to be even louder to convince even more people that we’re right.”
Forrest noted his other concern was that the demand to ban Walsh could impact his relationship with University administration. 
“It would have reduced my ability to negotiate and work with them on trying to address all of the other issues that I’m really focused on trying to make progress on this year, whether that’s campus safety, textbook and course material or (providing help to) students dealing with sexual assaults,” Forrest said. “They do appreciate and have respect for the fact that I didn’t ask them to do something that they legally couldn’t have done.”
Kalipi said she initially drafted a lengthy response that discussed why hate speech should not be protected, but the executive team decided to trash the whole statement and started a new one. Kalipi said she regrets approving the second statement and signing her name on it.
“For a second there, I fell into the politicians’ trap,” Kalipi said. “I was so nervous about how it would be if the executive (team) disagreed. I think that ultimately, I was just scared.”
Patrick Porter, senior in LAS and ISG Senator, said that the executive team excluded regular ISG members from the drafting process.
“There wasn’t even any discussion whatsoever, so when everybody else saw it, that was the first time I saw it,” Porter said. “I didn’t expect to see that kind of response.”
Porter said he and many in the Senate disagreed with Forrest’s rhetoric, which looks like it was “copied and pasted.” Porter argued it is the student government’s “minimum responsibility” to reaffirm their support for the LGBTQ+ community. He pointed out that redirecting the targeted transgender students to the University’s resources is not enough.
Knowing the lack of response from University administration, Porter said ISG could have taken this opportunity to show more decisive leadership. He said the response was so disappointing that he published a statement of his own, claiming that ISG must stand against hate speech.
“There are clearly many of us within ISG that weren’t happy with the position that we as an official body took … some of us don’t want to necessarily be associated with the statement,” Porter said. “If we were able to deliberate on this a little bit more to add our own insight into it, I’m not sure if it would have made any significant difference in this instance.”
Forrest clarified that multiple people were involved in the decision-making process, including Kalipi, who Forrest said was “a strong defender” of the position of Porter and many other ISG members. Forrest asserted that he has the right from the Student Government Constitution to unilaterally make a statement on behalf of ISG.
“I am the leader of this institution, and I’m not obligated to bring more people into the discussion when I’m making a post like that,” Forrest said. “I had to make what I believed was the right decision, and having more people involved in that discussion, I could say wasn’t going to change my mind about that fundamental issue of free speech.”
Mia Macias, junior in LAS, said she was mad when reading ISG’s response. She said she understood the free speech standards but believed more precautions could have been taken to protect transgender and nonbinary students. She said she expected to see informative massmails and helpful resources.
“I feel like there’s a lot that (ISG) can do in their power to at least try and stop something like this from happening again,” Macias said. “But, even if they had, it’s possible that someone like this could still come to campus, but it’s also the fact that they weren’t really willing to try.”
Forrest explained that he and Kalipi intended to put out a message earlier but suspended the decision because of their disagreement. Kalipi wanted to form an advocacy coalition to petition for change on a governmental level, an action that was opposed to Forrest’s arguments on free speech.
“The problem there was Vice President Kalipi’s position, essentially firmly that unless we’re calling for a ban, she wasn’t wanting to put a statement out,” Forrest said. “It was last minute because (of) the pressure that both of us wanted to say that we affirm the LGBTQ+ community and we don’t agree with Matt Walsh.”
Kalipi said Forrest “didn’t want any room for disagreement in the executive,” and she decided not to compromise to stay in ISG.
“I am really glad that ultimately I stuck to my morals because that’s what I should have done in the first place,” Kalipi said.
Macias said she was glad that Kalipi resigned.
“Really acknowledging the issue and resigning honestly spoke volumes because it shows that she cares,” Macias said. “But unfortunately, because of her co-workers, there was only so much that she could do.”
Porter noted there is a lack of communication within ISG, whether between branches or between the executive and regular Senate members. He said ISG had “awful” outreach and transparency to the student body.
“The only time that the student body really sees anything that ISG does is through these social media posts, and that really tarnished (its) reputation,” Porter said.
Under a recent Instagram post, ISG responded to Macias’ comment regarding trans rights, telling her that the student government has big plans to engage the LGBTQ+ community on campus. Marcias said she recognized the positive movement but felt upset about the late action initiated after LGBTQ+ students had already expressed their concerns.
“Okay, it’s great that you’re acknowledging it, but it’s something that should have already been done,” Macias said.
Biswas questioned how ISG would implement these plans.
“I don’t know what that means,” Biswas said. “Have they reached out to LGBTQ+ organizations? I want to see something.”
Kalipi and Porter both said they were not aware of previous discussions around the plans. Kalipi added that she believes there is no way for ISG to make up for what it did.
“Unless they spin it around and fight for hate speech not being protected under the First Amendment, there is nothing they could do that can override the mistakes that they made,” Kalipi said.
Forrest said ISG and the administrations are taking more steps on proactive communications. He said he is also getting feedback from critical workshops within ISG and open discussions with various student leaders. He said he agrees he didn’t do enough regarding the Matt Walsh situation and promised to do everything he can to protect students from hate speech.
Biswas said he thinks Forrest should resign, as Biswas believes the president fails to represent the students’ voice. He said he has been upset with the student government for a while and decided to run for senator next semester. He emphasized that he wants more ISG candidates who care about minorities.
Forrest said he understands why many students disagree with his insistence on free speech, and he feels incumbent to listen.
“There is so much more that unites us in terms of our commitment to protecting diversity … and we shouldn’t have to look at each other as enemies,” Forrest said. “I know that many of them look at me right now as a fundamentally bad person, as someone who doesn’t care about them, but I do care. And I am listening.”
Kalipi pointed out that the general morale in student government is low. She said she saw people wanting to make a change ended up shaping an “elitist institution.”
“I had hoped that a new assembly and the new VP would never be involved in student government culture, so things would be different,” Kalipi said. “But I think this whole thing just goes to show that there will always be an elite force that controls everything, so I don’t know.”

Forrest noted his other concern was that the demand to ban Walsh could impact his relationship with University administration. 
“It would have reduced my ability to negotiate and work with them on trying to address all of the other issues that I’m really focused on trying to make progress on this year, whether that’s campus safety, textbook and course material or (providing help to) students dealing with sexual assaults,” Forrest said. “They do appreciate and have respect for the fact that I didn’t ask them to do something that they legally couldn’t have done.”
Kalipi said she initially drafted a lengthy response that discussed why hate speech should not be protected, but the executive team decided to trash the whole statement and started a new one. Kalipi said she regrets approving the second statement and signing her name on it.
“For a second there, I fell into the politicians’ trap,” Kalipi said. “I was so nervous about how it would be if the executive (team) disagreed. I think that ultimately, I was just scared.”
Patrick Porter, senior in LAS and ISG Senator, said that the executive team excluded regular ISG members from the drafting process.
“There wasn’t even any discussion whatsoever, so when everybody else saw it, that was the first time I saw it,” Porter said. “I didn’t expect to see that kind of response.”
Porter said he and many in the Senate disagreed with Forrest’s rhetoric, which looks like it was “copied and pasted.” Porter argued it is the student government’s “minimum responsibility” to reaffirm their support for the LGBTQ+ community. He pointed out that redirecting the targeted transgender students to the University’s resources is not enough.
Knowing the lack of response from University administration, Porter said ISG could have taken this opportunity to show more decisive leadership. He said the response was so disappointing that he published a statement of his own, claiming that ISG must stand against hate speech.
“There are clearly many of us within ISG that weren’t happy with the position that we as an official body took … some of us don’t want to necessarily be associated with the statement,” Porter said. “If we were able to deliberate on this a little bit more to add our own insight into it, I’m not sure if it would have made any significant difference in this instance.”
Forrest clarified that multiple people were involved in the decision-making process, including Kalipi, who Forrest said was “a strong defender” of the position of Porter and many other ISG members. Forrest asserted that he has the right from the Student Government Constitution to unilaterally make a statement on behalf of ISG.
“I am the leader of this institution, and I’m not obligated to bring more people into the discussion when I’m making a post like that,” Forrest said. “I had to make what I believed was the right decision, and having more people involved in that discussion, I could say wasn’t going to change my mind about that fundamental issue of free speech.”
Mia Macias, junior in LAS, said she was mad when reading ISG’s response. She said she understood the free speech standards but believed more precautions could have been taken to protect transgender and nonbinary students. She said she expected to see informative massmails and helpful resources.
“I feel like there’s a lot that (ISG) can do in their power to at least try and stop something like this from happening again,” Macias said. “But, even if they had, it’s possible that someone like this could still come to campus, but it’s also the fact that they weren’t really willing to try.”
Forrest explained that he and Kalipi intended to put out a message earlier but suspended the decision because of their disagreement. Kalipi wanted to form an advocacy coalition to petition for change on a governmental level, an action that was opposed to Forrest’s arguments on free speech.
“The problem there was Vice President Kalipi’s position, essentially firmly that unless we’re calling for a ban, she wasn’t wanting to put a statement out,” Forrest said. “It was last minute because (of) the pressure that both of us wanted to say that we affirm the LGBTQ+ community and we don’t agree with Matt Walsh.”
Kalipi said Forrest “didn’t want any room for disagreement in the executive,” and she decided not to compromise to stay in ISG.
“I am really glad that ultimately I stuck to my morals because that’s what I should have done in the first place,” Kalipi said.
Macias said she was glad that Kalipi resigned.
“Really acknowledging the issue and resigning honestly spoke volumes because it shows that she cares,” Macias said. “But unfortunately, because of her co-workers, there was only so much that she could do.”
Porter noted there is a lack of communication within ISG, whether between branches or between the executive and regular Senate members. He said ISG had “awful” outreach and transparency to the student body.
“The only time that the student body really sees anything that ISG does is through these social media posts, and that really tarnished (its) reputation,” Porter said.
Under a recent Instagram post, ISG responded to Macias’ comment regarding trans rights, telling her that the student government has big plans to engage the LGBTQ+ community on campus. Marcias said she recognized the positive movement but felt upset about the late action initiated after LGBTQ+ students had already expressed their concerns.
“Okay, it’s great that you’re acknowledging it, but it’s something that should have already been done,” Macias said.
Biswas questioned how ISG would implement these plans.
“I don’t know what that means,” Biswas said. “Have they reached out to LGBTQ+ organizations? I want to see something.”
Kalipi and Porter both said they were not aware of previous discussions around the plans. Kalipi added that she believes there is no way for ISG to make up for what it did.
“Unless they spin it around and fight for hate speech not being protected under the First Amendment, there is nothing they could do that can override the mistakes that they made,” Kalipi said.
Forrest said ISG and the administrations are taking more steps on proactive communications. He said he is also getting feedback from critical workshops within ISG and open discussions with various student leaders. He said he agrees he didn’t do enough regarding the Matt Walsh situation and promised to do everything he can to protect students from hate speech.
Biswas said he thinks Forrest should resign, as Biswas believes the president fails to represent the students’ voice. He said he has been upset with the student government for a while and decided to run for senator next semester. He emphasized that he wants more ISG candidates who care about minorities.
Forrest said he understands why many students disagree with his insistence on free speech, and he feels incumbent to listen.
“There is so much more that unites us in terms of our commitment to protecting diversity … and we shouldn’t have to look at each other as enemies,” Forrest said. “I know that many of them look at me right now as a fundamentally bad person, as someone who doesn’t care about them, but I do care. And I am listening.”
Kalipi pointed out that the general morale in student government is low. She said she saw people wanting to make a change ended up shaping an “elitist institution.”
“I had hoped that a new assembly and the new VP would never be involved in student government culture, so things would be different,” Kalipi said. “But I think this whole thing just goes to show that there will always be an elite force that controls everything, so I don’t know.”

On Oct. 6, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh visited the University for a screening of his documentary “What is a Woman.” The same night, the Illinois Student Government posted a statement on its Instagram account. While expressing its support for the LGBTQ+ community as pointing out that Walsh’s claims are hateful, the statement declared that “free speech permits such discussion to occur.”
Students flooded to the Instagram comments, including Soumil Biswas, sophomore in ACES. He argued that the University, which prides itself on the inclusivity of LGBTQ+ individuals, should have prevented Matt Walsh from spreading hate speech against trans people.
“I don’t know if hate speech really consists of free speech, but the hate that was brought to trans people because of this event definitely does not align with the University’s beliefs, so they should not allow that to happen,” Biswas said.
Biswas said he believes ISG should have censored the event. He noted that the student government should represent the voice of the student body, and many in the student body were calling for condemnation.
“The statement ISG put out was very lackluster,” Biswas said. “It was kind of a dumb response because they could just condemn it or just stay silent.”
Four days after the incident, Vindhya Kalipi, junior in LAS, resigned from her position as the vice president of ISG. According to ISG’s announcement, Kalipi resigned over “a fundamental difference of opinion regarding free speech.”
Before Walsh’s arrival, Kalipi talked to administrators and looked through existing laws. She said she understood the Supreme Court has upheld that hate speech is technically protected under free speech. However, Kalipi said she was upset and believed ISG should take a stand and prohibit hate speech.
“We represent students, and we should be listening to what the student body that elected us and believed in us wants,” Kalipi said. “If the administration doesn’t want to do anything about it, at least we should be doing something.”
Kalipi recalled that she was frustrated when she found out she was the only executive member who believed hate speech should be prohibited.
President Garrett Forrest, junior in LAS, said that though he agrees Matt Walsh’s visit was harmful, he believes free speech is the foundation of democracy.
“The price of having free speech — the price of having a society where you don’t have to worry no matter who’s in power of your views being suppressed or you being punished for advocating for something … The price of that is hate speech,” Forrest said.
He mentioned the counter-protest outside Walsh’s discussion.
“When Matt Walsh was here, there was a counter protest outside there, highlighting the beautiful diversity of the LGBTQ+ community,” Forrest said. “I think it’s on those of us who are opposed to hate speech, who are opposed to the ideas being spread by people like Matt Walsh, to be even louder to convince even more people that we’re right.”
Forrest noted his other concern was that the demand to ban Walsh could impact his relationship with University administration. 
“It would have reduced my ability to negotiate and work with them on trying to address all of the other issues that I’m really focused on trying to make progress on this year, whether that’s campus safety, textbook and course material or (providing help to) students dealing with sexual assaults,” Forrest said. “They do appreciate and have respect for the fact that I didn’t ask them to do something that they legally couldn’t have done.”
Kalipi said she initially drafted a lengthy response that discussed why hate speech should not be protected, but the executive team decided to trash the whole statement and started a new one. Kalipi said she regrets approving the second statement and signing her name on it.

Many classes at the University have strict attendance policies and expectations for student performance in class. Some students and faculty believe these policies are outdated and do not adequately account for mental health issues, ability levels and individual student responsibility. 
Some classes have attendance policies as strict as two absences before grade penalties begin, while other classes have no attendance policy. Some professors require documentation to prove that a student was actually ill, while others don’t even ask to know why a student missed class. 
MJ Lee, a graduate student studying materials engineering, said classes like seminars and discussions are perfectly valid in asking for mandatory attendance. 
“If someone worked a bunch on their seminar presenting their research … and then no one shows up, that’s not okay,” Lee said. “It’s highly unprofessional and frankly, it’s rude.”
Zachariah McVicker, an instructor in the Department of English, agrees that discussion classes need to be interactive.

“Nothing is worse than just an instructor or a professor talking for an hour and a half at the front of the room and no one else is contributing,” McVicker said. 
But McVicker still sees a problem with mandatory attendance in discussions. He said that while instructors may have attendance policies to encourage lively participation, that is not always the outcome.
“Oftentimes, a strict policy can do just the opposite, right?” McVicker said. “If you’re making students sit in a chair, then there’s a good chance that a portion of those students are going to, in my experience, sort of visibly express the fact that they’re required to be there.”
McVicker said attendance policies can have the opposite outcome than the expected.
“At best, it’s wanting to have a lively classroom full of discussion,” McVicker said. “I don’t think an attendance policy often accomplishes that.” 
Billy Huff, a lecturer in the Department of Communication, believes tradition is one of the reasons these attendance policies still exist.
“We tend to teach the way we were taught, right? And so these things keep getting passed down,” Huff said. 
Kiki Kitsinis, senior in Media, thinks many professors are not accustomed to considering students’ mental health in their attendance policies. 
“A lot of these professors come from a time where college was very different for them — universities were so different,” Kitsinis said. “For them, mental illness was taboo. It wasn’t something they talked about.” 
Madeline Udelhofen, senior in LAS, said attendance policies that only allow two or three days off in a semester do not meet students’ needs. Especially if a student is struggling with mental health issues, these policies can do more harm than good. 
“People struggling … it doesn’t just only affect you three days throughout the semester,” Udelhofen said.
Kitsinis asks faculty to be understanding and accommodating. Kitsinis — who is diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD from a previous cancer diagnosis — said she can’t always make herself get out of bed to go to class. 
“Please understand that we, as students, deal with a lot, and you don’t really know what we go through on the inside,” Kitsinis said. 
Udelhofen said that strict attendance policies force students to go to class when it may be healthier for them to stay home. 
“People force themselves to go to class because they’re scared that their grade is going to go down and that can exacerbate … mental health issues,” Udelhofen said.
Deveshi Thakur, who is enrolled in Engineering but is currently on retroactive medical leave due to health issues, deals with anxiety and said that explaining her absences from class was stressful. 
“I was really scared of potentially emailing the professor to let them know, ‘Hey, I missed class today because I was sick’ … and just the possibility that they would reply not believing me,” Thakur said.
Udelhofen said that whenever she tells a professor why she was absent, she feels the need to go into detail so she’s more likely to be believed. 
Elisabeth Funck, a graduate student studying aerospace and astronautical engineering, sees a disparity between students who are not athletes and student-athletes are treated. 
She said that she was unable to get excused absences for attending a conference related to her career, yet student-athletes are always excused for sport-related activities. She does not think this is fair. 
Some classes still require a doctor’s note as evidence of an excused absence. The University’s Student Code states that “Because McKinley Health Center does not provide medical excuses, instructors should be aware that a student may not be able to provide formal documentation for minor illnesses of less than three days.”
Thakur, who has a disability, agrees that sickness documentation can be difficult to obtain. 
“Who has that money?” Thakur said. “Are you paying for the appointment? No, I don’t think so … I’m a student. I don’t have time to be running to Carle every single time (I get sick). 
“If I said I was sick, I was probably f****** sick.” 
One student who wished to remain anonymous said they got sick the day before they were planning to travel. The student informed their professor that they missed class for health reasons and provided the professor with a doctor’s note from Carle. There was a test in class on the day the student missed, but the professor did not allow the student to make it up.
“She said it was too fishy and that it was like I had planned this, even though I had a signed letter from Carle saying that I have a sinus infection and that I needed to stay home,” the student said. 
Huff said he doesn’t need to know why students miss class because he wants to respect their privacy. He does not currently enforce an attendance policy because he believes they are ableist.
“I used to actually have an attendance policy,” Huff said. “I can’t believe it when I think back on it.”
Huff said his mind was changed after a student talked to him about attendance policies.
“I had a student who was a chair user who came up to me one day after class and he said, ‘You know, disabled kids never got the attendance award in school, right?’” Huff said. “It made me realize that I was rewarding students who had the ability to come to class everyday and that not all students had that ability. I was being ableist in that policy.” 
Thakur said having a disability makes attending class a more complicated process for her than for others. She wants faculty to understand that there are many factors that go into a student missing class, and it’s different for every student. 
“It presents a lot of issues for me,” Thakur said. “Sensory issues are a big one. I feel like as soon as I leave my dorm, I was asking for a lot for the day. Like, riding the bus over to campus, the volume and lack of space … was kind of debilitating for me.
“That was a hurdle I had to cross every single time I had to go to class. And the amount of brainpower that takes up doesn’t really leave a lot for actual learning.
“I felt so guilty, you know? I don’t think anybody who’s in these sorts of situations wants to be; we’re not slacking off. We don’t want to not come to class and then miss out on whatever everybody is learning … It’s just like being backed into a corner.”
Thakur has accommodations from Disability Resources & Educational Services (DRES) but has had issues with an accommodation that allows her one day extensions or alternative assignments if her disability prevents her from functioning for a day. Her DRES specialist told her that she may run into issues using the accommodation within the Department of Computer Science. 
“She said one of the (other) students she worked with … had struggled with something,” Thakur said. “They were trying to make use of that accommodation. When they reached out to the professor, the professor argued. You’re legally not allowed to deny a student use of them. So then the specialist had to email this professor back and forth for two weeks.
“Just the thought of having to engage in something like that stressed me out so much that, in my mind, as soon as she said that, I was like ‘OK, so I’m never gonna use this.’”
Thakur’s health declined during the Spring 2022 semester, which is why she is currently on retroactive medical leave. She said she performed relatively well on tests and did classwork, but her attendance was a factor that brought her grades down. She felt that her transcript was not an accurate reflection of the work she put in for the semester.
“Sometimes, I still wonder if it would have been manageable if the environment didn’t feel so hostile,” Thakur said. “I really feel like the College of Engineering, when it comes to things like these, is a lot less accommodating. The culture they cultivate, it doesn’t seem very compassionate at all.” 
A student who wished to remain anonymous was sexually assaulted in 2021, and in an unrelated incident, their apartment was broken into by a stranger having a schizophrenic episode. The student is diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression and PTSD.
The morning after the stranger broke into the student’s apartment, the student emailed their professor regarding a quiz due the next day. They asked for an extension and explained that they had one of their worst panic attacks to date because of the upsetting night. The student said the professor was not accommodating. 
“He basically told me that it would be unfair to other students in the class if I was given an extension … I received a zero on the quiz,” the student said. 
The student currently has DRES accommodations but did not at the time of the incident. 
“I think it’s absolute bullshit that a student would need to get accommodations in order for a professor to treat their mental health or physical health seriously,” the student said. “I would love to be a normal human with no depression, no anxiety, no PTSD based on my sexual assault, but I’m not. I was given this lot, I can’t change it. I have to deal with it.” 
Funck said that the University is more about everyone working for themselves. Likewise, Thakur thinks students should be responsible for their own attendance. 
“At the end of the day, everybody that comes to college comes after having turned 18, for the most part, we’re all adults, so it should be on us,” Thakur said. 
Funck thinks the student should always be the priority.
“At the end of the day, it’s about the student, not the professor,” Funck said.

“It presents a lot of issues for me,” Thakur said. “Sensory issues are a big one. I feel like as soon as I leave my dorm, I was asking for a lot for the day. Like, riding the bus over to campus, the volume and lack of space … was kind of debilitating for me.
“That was a hurdle I had to cross every single time I had to go to class. And the amount of brainpower that takes up doesn’t really leave a lot for actual learning.
“I felt so guilty, you know? I don’t think anybody who’s in these sorts of situations wants to be; we’re not slacking off. We don’t want to not come to class and then miss out on whatever everybody is learning … It’s just like being backed into a corner.”
Thakur has accommodations from Disability Resources & Educational Services (DRES) but has had issues with an accommodation that allows her one day extensions or alternative assignments if her disability prevents her from functioning for a day. Her DRES specialist told her that she may run into issues using the accommodation within the Department of Computer Science. 
“She said one of the (other) students she worked with … had struggled with something,” Thakur said. “They were trying to make use of that accommodation. When they reached out to the professor, the professor argued. You’re legally not allowed to deny a student use of them. So then the specialist had to email this professor back and forth for two weeks.
“Just the thought of having to engage in something like that stressed me out so much that, in my mind, as soon as she said that, I was like ‘OK, so I’m never gonna use this.’”
Thakur’s health declined during the Spring 2022 semester, which is why she is currently on retroactive medical leave. She said she performed relatively well on tests and did classwork, but her attendance was a factor that brought her grades down. She felt that her transcript was not an accurate reflection of the work she put in for the semester.
“Sometimes, I still wonder if it would have been manageable if the environment didn’t feel so hostile,” Thakur said. “I really feel like the College of Engineering, when it comes to things like these, is a lot less accommodating. The culture they cultivate, it doesn’t seem very compassionate at all.” 
A student who wished to remain anonymous was sexually assaulted in 2021, and in an unrelated incident, their apartment was broken into by a stranger having a schizophrenic episode. The student is diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression and PTSD.
The morning after the stranger broke into the student’s apartment, the student emailed their professor regarding a quiz due the next day. They asked for an extension and explained that they had one of their worst panic attacks to date because of the upsetting night. The student said the professor was not accommodating. 
“He basically told me that it would be unfair to other students in the class if I was given an extension … I received a zero on the quiz,” the student said. 
The student currently has DRES accommodations but did not at the time of the incident. 
“I think it’s absolute bullshit that a student would need to get accommodations in order for a professor to treat their mental health or physical health seriously,” the student said. “I would love to be a normal human with no depression, no anxiety, no PTSD based on my sexual assault, but I’m not. I was given this lot, I can’t change it. I have to deal with it.” 
Funck said that the University is more about everyone working for themselves. Likewise, Thakur thinks students should be responsible for their own attendance. 
“At the end of the day, everybody that comes to college comes after having turned 18, for the most part, we’re all adults, so it should be on us,” Thakur said. 
Funck thinks the student should always be the priority.
“At the end of the day, it’s about the student, not the professor,” Funck said.

The Daily Illini • October 18, 2022 • https://dailyillini.com/news-stories/longform/2022/10/18/attendance-policies-mental-health/

Many classes at the University have strict attendance policies and expectations for student performance in class. Some students and faculty believe these policies are outdated and do not adequately account for mental health issues, ability levels and individual student responsibility. 
Some classes have attendance policies as strict as two absences before grade penalties begin, while other classes have no attendance policy. Some professors require documentation to prove that a student was actually ill, while others don’t even ask to know why a student missed class. 
MJ Lee, a graduate student studying materials engineering, said classes like seminars and discussions are perfectly valid in asking for mandatory attendance. 
“If someone worked a bunch on their seminar presenting their research … and then no one shows up, that’s not okay,” Lee said. “It’s highly unprofessional and frankly, it’s rude.”
Zachariah McVicker, an instructor in the Department of English, agrees that discussion classes need to be interactive.
“Nothing is worse than just an instructor or a professor talking for an hour and a half at the front of the room and no one else is contributing,” McVicker said. 
But McVicker still sees a problem with mandatory attendance in discussions. He said that while instructors may have attendance policies to encourage lively participation, that is not always the outcome.
“Oftentimes, a strict policy can do just the opposite, right?” McVicker said. “If you’re making students sit in a chair, then there’s a good chance that a portion of those students are going to, in my experience, sort of visibly express the fact that they’re required to be there.”
McVicker said attendance policies can have the opposite outcome than the expected.
“At best, it’s wanting to have a lively classroom full of discussion,” McVicker said. “I don’t think an attendance policy often accomplishes that.” 
Billy Huff, a lecturer in the Department of Communication, believes tradition is one of the reasons these attendance policies still exist.
“We tend to teach the way we were taught, right? And so these things keep getting passed down,” Huff said. 
Kiki Kitsinis, senior in Media, thinks many professors are not accustomed to considering students’ mental health in their attendance policies. 
“A lot of these professors come from a time where college was very different for them — universities were so different,” Kitsinis said. “For them, mental illness was taboo. It wasn’t something they talked about.” 
Madeline Udelhofen, senior in LAS, said attendance policies that only allow two or three days off in a semester do not meet students’ needs. Especially if a student is struggling with mental health issues, these policies can do more harm than good. 
“People struggling … it doesn’t just only affect you three days throughout the semester,” Udelhofen said.
Kitsinis asks faculty to be understanding and accommodating. Kitsinis — who is diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD from a previous cancer diagnosis — said she can’t always make herself get out of bed to go to class. 
“Please understand that we, as students, deal with a lot, and you don’t really know what we go through on the inside,” Kitsinis said. 
Udelhofen said that strict attendance policies force students to go to class when it may be healthier for them to stay home. 
“People force themselves to go to class because they’re scared that their grade is going to go down and that can exacerbate … mental health issues,” Udelhofen said.
Deveshi Thakur, who is enrolled in Engineering but is currently on retroactive medical leave due to health issues, deals with anxiety and said that explaining her absences from class was stressful. 
“I was really scared of potentially emailing the professor to let them know, ‘Hey, I missed class today because I was sick’ … and just the possibility that they would reply not believing me,” Thakur said.
Udelhofen said that whenever she tells a professor why she was absent, she feels the need to go into detail so she’s more likely to be believed. 
Elisabeth Funck, a graduate student studying aerospace and astronautical engineering, sees a disparity between students who are not athletes and student-athletes are treated. 
She said that she was unable to get excused absences for attending a conference related to her career, yet student-athletes are always excused for sport-related activities. She does not think this is fair. 
Some classes still require a doctor’s note as evidence of an excused absence. The University’s Student Code states that “Because McKinley Health Center does not provide medical excuses, instructors should be aware that a student may not be able to provide formal documentation for minor illnesses of less than three days.”
Thakur, who has a disability, agrees that sickness documentation can be difficult to obtain. 
“Who has that money?” Thakur said. “Are you paying for the appointment? No, I don’t think so … I’m a student. I don’t have time to be running to Carle every single time (I get sick). 
“If I said I was sick, I was probably f****** sick.” 
One student who wished to remain anonymous said they got sick the day before they were planning to travel. The student informed their professor that they missed class for health reasons and provided the professor with a doctor’s note from Carle. There was a test in class on the day the student missed, but the professor did not allow the student to make it up.
“She said it was too fishy and that it was like I had planned this, even though I had a signed letter from Carle saying that I have a sinus infection and that I needed to stay home,” the student said. 
Huff said he doesn’t need to know why students miss class because he wants to respect their privacy. He does not currently enforce an attendance policy because he believes they are ableist.
“I used to actually have an attendance policy,” Huff said. “I can’t believe it when I think back on it.”
Huff said his mind was changed after a student talked to him about attendance policies.
“I had a student who was a chair user who came up to me one day after class and he said, ‘You know, disabled kids never got the attendance award in school, right?’” Huff said. “It made me realize that I was rewarding students who had the ability to come to class everyday and that not all students had that ability. I was being ableist in that policy.” 
Thakur said having a disability makes attending class a more complicated process for her than for others. She wants faculty to understand that there are many factors that go into a student missing class, and it’s different for every student. 
“It presents a lot of issues for me,” Thakur said. “Sensory issues are a big one. I feel like as soon as I leave my dorm, I was asking for a lot for the day. Like, riding the bus over to campus, the volume and lack of space … was kind of debilitating for me.

The University made headlines in 2021 for accepting its largest freshman class in University history, with 8,303 new students headed way. University enrollment broke 50,000 for the first time in fall 2019 and has stayed above ever since.
The University also made headlines this time last year, when stresses from the COVID-19 pandemic led to University Housing converting lounges into temporary dorms. The record number of incoming freshmen also coincided with a large number of students opting to return to campus housing following a year of remote instruction.
The number of students on campus, both new and returning, has been increasing year after year, raising concerns about whether or not University Housing has enough living space for every accepted student.
Every first-year undergraduate student, including first-year transfer students coming to the University with less than 30 credit hours, must live in University Housing to fulfill their residency requirement. In addition to University Housing, students can live in one of the University’s 13 Private Certified Housing options to fulfill the requirement.
According to Mari Anne Brocker Curry, director of housing information & marketing for University Housing, University Housing has a maximum capacity of roughly 9,400 spaces, plus an additional 2,900 spaces in Private Certified Housing. These roughly 12,300 spaces provide ample space for incoming freshmen, plus returning students who don’t wish to begin off-campus living yet.

Curry said that University Housing is currently well equipped to handle increasing numbers of students.
“(We have) no plans to expand/increase capacity in the immediate future,” Curry said. “We value the diversity and support provided through communities that have a mixture of new and continuing students. In general, our capacity is configured to have enough space for both new and returning students.”
The exact number of students in each incoming freshman class varies from year to year. This year’s incoming class saw a slight decrease from the record high in 2021, with 7,957 freshmen coming to campus for the Fall 2022 semester. Despite some single year-to-year decreases in admitted students, the freshman class has been increasing on the whole throughout recent history.
In 2014, 6,937 freshmen made up the incoming class — over a thousand students less than this year’s class. 20 years earlier, in 1994, only 5,690 students made their way to campus. At current rates, it would take until 2076 for the incoming freshman class to be too large to fit into University Housing.
Dan Mann, associate provost for Enrollment Management, noted that there is no hard-set upper limit for the number of students admitted into a given class. Instead, enrollment targets are set after thorough discussions with administrators across campus.
“Representatives from Undergraduate Admissions and the colleges meet each year to discuss enrollment targets for the next freshmen class,” Mann said. “Enrollment targets are normally determined based on current enrollment levels, available resources, market demand and plans for future program changes. After these conversations, recommended enrollment targets are prepared and sent to the provost to review and approve.”
One challenge any college admissions team faces is the yield rate. The yield rate is the number of students who accept their admission over the number of students offered admission. While an admissions team can control the number of students they accept, they cannot control how many of those students accept their offer of admission and end up enrolling.
While the University does not make their yield rate public, other colleges and universities have run into housing problems when their yield rate was higher than expected. A situation like this at Purdue made headlines in 2018 for dismal pictures of makeshift dorms. Taken to its extreme, a higher than expected yield rate can result in colleges rescinding offers of admission, such as UC Irvine did in 2017.
Some students suggest that University Housing is far from having a shortage of living spaces. Mike Liu, a graduate student studying aerospace engineering, said that even though he was late to apply to University Housing, he was able to secure a spot with no problem.
“I signed the housing contract pretty late and still got a single room, and they put me in another room on the same floor for summer housing because I arrived on campus too early,” Liu said. “So (it was) pretty smooth to me at least.”
Liu, who is also a first-year international student, said housing options were limited at his previous universities and he was surprised that there were still campus housing options available when he signed the contract in early July.
Having space to accommodate not just freshmen, but also returning students in University Housing remains a top priority for Curry and University Housing. According to Curry, utilizing University Housing for more than a year often correlates with academic success.
“Students who live in certified housing for two or more years are more likely to graduate and graduate in four years than a student who moves out after only one year,” Curry said.

Joseph Lyding, professor in Engineering, and Branden Wolan, graduate student studying electrical and computer engineering, pose with the 3D printed carbon nanotube film in the Nick Holonyak Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory on Friday. 

By Aditya Sayal, Assistant Investigative News & Longform Editor September 16, 2022
At the University of Illinois, researchers have been developing carbon nanotubes — manufacturable, adaptive material with many applicable uses. They are only one-to-two nanometers in size but have great tensile strength, great thermal conductivity, strong electromagnetic interference shielding performance, solid water-repellant properties and established multi-functionality. 
The issue is that these properties aren’t available in bulk and used to be expensive. However, the Lyding Group has found that there are ways to circumvent these issues.
When trying to make the nanotubes stick together while retaining the properties of an individual tube, the Lyding Group found that if they mixed nanotubes with a different polymeric material — a cold blend of nanotubes plus polymer — the exquisite properties were watered down. The group’s study found a way to make pure, straight carbon nanotubes without the polymer, which resulted in a dramatic enhancement of these properties.  
“By eliminating the use of a polymeric tightening agent to hold the nanotubes together, we get closer to the intrinsic properties that carbon nanotubes have,” said Joseph W. Lyding, professor in Engineering and leader of Lyding Group. “We still have a ways to go, but we made a big step in improving the properties.” 
He detailed another development that improves the carbon nanotubes further. “We have an agent that allows the carbon nanotubes to be converted into an ink that we can 3D print,” Lyding said. “We can get rid of (the agent) completely after the printing, so we are just left with pure carbon nanotubes.” 

Brendan Wolan, a graduate student studying electrical and computer engineering and co-author of the Lyding Group study, mentioned that in the paper, they were able to demonstrate a way that they could give a significant amount of direction to these tubes without much effort. 
“It’s really tricky to find ways to manipulate countless amounts of these particles in a really consistent manner,” Wolan said. “And so what we did in the paper is we disperse it back into a solution.” Wolan noted that this is done by injecting the carbon nanotubes into a coagulation bath through a long syringe needle. 
According to Wolan, because the tubes are very long but very skinny, there is a fluidic force exerted upon them. That makes them all want to line up within the syringe because it’s going to lower the resistance to the flow. With all the carbon nanotubes lined up in the syringe, they eventually lie down and align with the direction of printing. 
Wolan explained that with the 3D printer, one could program it to do whatever shape they want, which includes the film associated with the carbon nanotubes. According to Wolan, this method allows for “radical improvements in terms of tensile strength, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.” 
This development makes the thermal conductivity of the carbon nanotubes better than that of copper, while the nanotubes themselves weigh less than copper as well. Wolan noted that these characteristics make the single-walled carbon nanotubes promising for industries such as aerospace.
According to Lyding, this material has many general applications as well. Lyding explained that the material is very good at electromagnetic shielding, so if one wanted shielding and a phone immune to electromagnetic interference, they would be able to use this material, as it is quite thin and light. In addition, carbon nanotubes are already being used in high-end sports such as skiing, golf and tennis. 
From an electronics standpoint, Lyding noted that many companies want to be able to make transistors — electric components used in electrical circuits to either amplify or switch electrical signals or power — smaller.
However, once individuals try to go smaller, they enter the quantum world, which opens up more issues such as a quantum tunnel, which contains a leakage current between two metal transistor electrodes. The leakage happens when the gap between the electrodes narrows to the point that electrons are no longer contained by their barriers. 
The value of a transistor is whether an individual knows if it is on or off and because carbon nanotubes have a directional orientation, they help in answering that issue.
Regarding the future of carbon nanotubes, there is a lot left in terms of improving the properties of these materials. For example, connecting pieces of metal together often involves welding or soldering, but that isn’t possible with carbon nanotubes. However, there has been progress. Brendan Wolan was able to set up this process of 3D printing carbon nanotubes in a facility at Northrop Grumman in summer of 2021.  
In addition, undergraduate students have been allowed access to this technology in classes such as ECE 481: Nanotechnology and ECE 518: Advanced Semiconductor Nanotechnology. Lyding said that in these classes, they aim to not repeat the same experiment but instead explore other experiments with the material, allowing for further insights into the technology. 
According to Wolan, Beckman has done a great job in allowing opportunities such as the carbon nanotubes study to be researched further. “Beckman and the (College of Engineering) do a really great job of centralizing all this expensive technology that so many people are using, and you have access to these experts in their field regarding these instruments,” Wolan said.
Lyding echoed the points that Wolan said regarding Beckman. “Interacting with people at Beckman and all these people wandering around the building and talking to each other in an informal sense leads to people starting to work together and realizing they can help each other out,” Lyding said. “Having all those perspectives in one place under one roof makes a huge difference, and that’s what Beckman is all about.”

At the University of Illinois, researchers have been developing carbon nanotubes — manufacturable, adaptive material with many applicable uses. They are only one-to-two nanometers in size but have great tensile strength, great thermal conductivity, strong electromagnetic interference shielding performance, solid water-repellant properties and established multi-functionality. 
The issue is that these properties aren’t available in bulk and used to be expensive. However, the Lyding Group has found that there are ways to circumvent these issues.
When trying to make the nanotubes stick together while retaining the properties of an individual tube, the Lyding Group found that if they mixed nanotubes with a different polymeric material — a cold blend of nanotubes plus polymer — the exquisite properties were watered down. The group’s study found a way to make pure, straight carbon nanotubes without the polymer, which resulted in a dramatic enhancement of these properties.  
“By eliminating the use of a polymeric tightening agent to hold the nanotubes together, we get closer to the intrinsic properties that carbon nanotubes have,” said Joseph W. Lyding, professor in Engineering and leader of Lyding Group. “We still have a ways to go, but we made a big step in improving the properties.” 
He detailed another development that improves the carbon nanotubes further. “We have an agent that allows the carbon nanotubes to be converted into an ink that we can 3D print,” Lyding said. “We can get rid of (the agent) completely after the printing, so we are just left with pure carbon nanotubes.” 

Brendan Wolan, a graduate student studying electrical and computer engineering and co-author of the Lyding Group study, mentioned that in the paper, they were able to demonstrate a way that they could give a significant amount of direction to these tubes without much effort. 
“It’s really tricky to find ways to manipulate countless amounts of these particles in a really consistent manner,” Wolan said. “And so what we did in the paper is we disperse it back into a solution.” Wolan noted that this is done by injecting the carbon nanotubes into a coagulation bath through a long syringe needle. 
According to Wolan, because the tubes are very long but very skinny, there is a fluidic force exerted upon them. That makes them all want to line up within the syringe because it’s going to lower the resistance to the flow. With all the carbon nanotubes lined up in the syringe, they eventually lie down and align with the direction of printing. 
Wolan explained that with the 3D printer, one could program it to do whatever shape they want, which includes the film associated with the carbon nanotubes. According to Wolan, this method allows for “radical improvements in terms of tensile strength, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.” 
This development makes the thermal conductivity of the carbon nanotubes better than that of copper, while the nanotubes themselves weigh less than copper as well. Wolan noted that these characteristics make the single-walled carbon nanotubes promising for industries such as aerospace.
According to Lyding, this material has many general applications as well. Lyding explained that the material is very good at electromagnetic shielding, so if one wanted shielding and a phone immune to electromagnetic interference, they would be able to use this material, as it is quite thin and light. In addition, carbon nanotubes are already being used in high-end sports such as skiing, golf and tennis. 
From an electronics standpoint, Lyding noted that many companies want to be able to make transistors — electric components used in electrical circuits to either amplify or switch electrical signals or power — smaller.
However, once individuals try to go smaller, they enter the quantum world, which opens up more issues such as a quantum tunnel, which contains a leakage current between two metal transistor electrodes. The leakage happens when the gap between the electrodes narrows to the point that electrons are no longer contained by their barriers. 
The value of a transistor is whether an individual knows if it is on or off and because carbon nanotubes have a directional orientation, they help in answering that issue.
Regarding the future of carbon nanotubes, there is a lot left in terms of improving the properties of these materials. For example, connecting pieces of metal together often involves welding or soldering, but that isn’t possible with carbon nanotubes. However, there has been progress. Brendan Wolan was able to set up this process of 3D printing carbon nanotubes in a facility at Northrop Grumman in summer of 2021.  
In addition, undergraduate students have been allowed access to this technology in classes such as ECE 481: Nanotechnology and ECE 518: Advanced Semiconductor Nanotechnology. Lyding said that in these classes, they aim to not repeat the same experiment but instead explore other experiments with the material, allowing for further insights into the technology. 
According to Wolan, Beckman has done a great job in allowing opportunities such as the carbon nanotubes study to be researched further. “Beckman and the (College of Engineering) do a really great job of centralizing all this expensive technology that so many people are using, and you have access to these experts in their field regarding these instruments,” Wolan said.

Oil, or petroleum, is often nicknamed “black gold” for its critical value in society. It can be refined into various forms of fuel, like gasoline or diesel, which power modern machinery. Oil remains a staple in the lives of many in the United States due to its role in the economy; the modern infrastructure of the US relies on oil to run.
Recently, the price of gasoline has increased significantly, causing great concern throughout the country. This rise in gas prices rests upon complex processes rooted in economics and politics. Since oil is a finite, naturally occurring fossil fuel, it is a highly valuable commodity to countries with access to it, leading to political and economic engagements that can restrict that same access. 
The increase in the price of gas is also tied to an increase in the price of oil, which has been caused by a few distinct factors. When viewed as a market commodity, oil is subject to processes of shifting supply and demand.
Don Fullerton, professor in Business, said that generally, there are constant trends of increased industrialization around the globe that drive up demand for oil while depleting an already finite supply. Then, the equilibrium price (the point at which demand and supply meet) gradually increases because the demand curve expands while the supply curve contracts. Although the increase in demand is constant, the decrease in supply is not, leading to a fluctuating price. 
“I love when someone asks me a question like, ‘Will the price increase or decrease?’ because the answer is yes,” Fullerton said. “It will do both.”

Though the global supply of oil is being depleted in the long-run, in the short-run, it moves up and down due to various surprise factors like wars or economic and political situations or new extraction technologies. The volatility of the oil supply leads to the equilibrium price fluctuating either to meet demand or to lag behind it. 
For prices to have increased so suddenly and sharply as they have this year, multiple surprise factors had to occur. 
“There are transient political factors, seasonal factors and some long-term trends,” said George Deltas, Department Head of Economics, in an email.  
The political factors are rooted in unfavorable engagements with oil-producing countries. In fact, the war in Ukraine is a major catalyst for the situation; given how oil is a major Russian export, the sanctions imposed on Russia have cut off access to a significant supply of oil.
“The transient political factors consist of the disruption in the global oil market following the sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine coupled with the unwillingness of some key Middle Eastern OPEC producers to increase their output,” Deltas said in an email, OPEC standing for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Another political factor lies in efforts to avoid severe impacts from the sanctions by negotiating with OPEC producers. However, some of these producers have not been willing or able to increase output to meet demands. 
This web of political and economic factors coincides with two additional, trend-related factors. One of these is a seasonal factor related to a yearly-occurring trend, and one is a long-term factor related to oil production investments.
“The seasonal factor is simply the tendency of gasoline prices to increase in the summer because of the vacation-induced demand in North America and Europe,” Deltas said. “The long-term trend is more subtle.”
Deltas explained the logistics of the long-term trend, clarifying the change of oil producers’ actions from the past to the current state of affairs.
“In the past, oil producers would respond to high oil prices by ramping up development of oil fields,” Deltas said. “Over time, this would help bring prices down. Nowadays, oil producers appear reluctant to invest heavily in new fields, especially those with large up-front costs. This is possibly out of fear that climate change concerns will eventually reduce oil demand and prices, and they will not be able to recoup the initial investment.” 
The increase in prices that was gradually taking place from trends was sharply accelerated by the political factors that took shape. The outcome of this situation could take various routes. 
Deltas claimed that the situation is very likely to stabilize. The transient political and seasonal factors mentioned earlier are, by definition, not permanent. The summer peak season is on its way out, which should stabilize prices, and though the war in Ukraine will not likely end anytime soon, there are ongoing diplomatic talks with OPEC countries to get them to help with oil production, which will likely stabilize the price.
Fullerton brought up the further uncertainty of surprise factors.
“We cannot anticipate surprises,” Fullerton said. “We don’t know whether the next surprise will make prices go higher because of another war or lower because a whole new oil reserve is discovered somewhere in the world.”
Fullerton added that if the war ends soon, or if sanctions are lifted, or if some agreement is reached with OPEC producers, the price should fall again and return to relative normalcy. He noted that there is a chance that the situation could worsen, but this would depend on the war itself worsening and especially if sanctions continue or if an embargo is placed on Russia.
While the situation develops into one of the possible outcomes, there are ways that one can navigate through it and prepare for any other similar scenarios.
Fullerton recommended looking into owning an electric vehicle, especially given how the price of oil is expected to steadily increase over time. He added that if the use of electric or hybrid vehicles increases enough, it would drive the demand and, therefore, the price of gas down. 
According to Fullerton, some long-term remedy will have to come from adoption of electric vehicles, political agreements or economic deals with other oil producers. Regarding the short term, Fullerton emphasized that one should “prepare for possible short-run jumps upward” because they often happen without warning. 
Furthermore, Fullerton noted that students will not be too heavily impacted by rising gas prices because their lifestyle generally requires minimal driving. He explained that those who will be most impacted are people who live in more car-dependent areas like suburbs, which many students come from. Many citizens of Urbana-Champaign are dependent on cars as well, so they are liable to be impacted in the same way.
For University students, Fullerton suggested living closer to campus in an apartment within walking distance of stores and school, using a bike, getting an electric or hybrid vehicle, carpooling or utilizing public transport. 
Public transportation in Champaign-Urbana remains a popular option for students to travel around campus due to its availability and accessibility for students. The buses in Urbana-Champaign are designed to be fuel-efficient and sustainable, making them reliable and resilient during fuel-related economic situations.
Amy Snyder, MTD Chief of Staff, said that buses have not been very affected by the rise in gas prices because they run on diesel fuel, which is cheaper, and because most buses are hybrid. 
“Ninety-eight percent are hybrid and use batteries that are powered by a regenerative braking system, which results in a thirty to forty-five percent reduction of fuel consumption,” Snyder said.
There are 114 buses, four that run completely on diesel and will be retired by the end of the year and two hydrogen fuel cell electric buses powered by hydrogen that is made on site by solar power. The rest are hybrid, using a combination of diesel and regenerative braking.
Snyder added that buses are not very fast, averaging about 11 to 20 miles per hour, which means they don’t use a whole lot of fuel. 
The main problem to watch out for regarding buses is a workforce shortage. MTD is still recovering from the pandemic’s effects on the available workforce, so there are not enough bus operators to run at full capacity. Snyder said that there is “twenty percent less service and less frequencies on some routes.” 
The routes that will be affected in the coming school year are 22/220 Illini, 12 Teal Daytime, 13/130 Silver and 10 Gold, which will see less frequency. As advice to those interested in using public transport more often, Snyder said to plan fresh trips (meaning trips that aren’t planned from memory of routes in past years), use updated GPS real-time information available on the MTD app and website and sign up for an account on MTD, which allows users to get real-time updates.
Deltas emphasized that the situation taking place now with gas prices is nothing new and will inevitably be over soon and that there will be a return to some level of normalcy.
“If you go back to 1979 and 1980, the price per gallon is lower, but if you adjust the price for the purchasing power of the dollar, the price is not much higher than it was before,” Deltas said. “It’s an unpleasant experience, but the prices will go down; it doesn’t last very long. This will pass sooner than people think so we shouldn’t overreact.”  
Although the situation will pass, it is still part of the ongoing long-term trend of lessening supply and increasing demand, and it provides an insight into the effects of short-term surprise situations, which are liable to recur. 
“The general trend that people should expect in the long term is increase in the price of gasoline,” Fullerton said. “They shouldn’t be surprised if, in the long run, the price goes up to six or seven dollars a gallon.”

“We cannot anticipate surprises,” Fullerton said. “We don’t know whether the next surprise will make prices go higher because of another war or lower because a whole new oil reserve is discovered somewhere in the world.”
Fullerton added that if the war ends soon, or if sanctions are lifted, or if some agreement is reached with OPEC producers, the price should fall again and return to relative normalcy. He noted that there is a chance that the situation could worsen, but this would depend on the war itself worsening and especially if sanctions continue or if an embargo is placed on Russia.
While the situation develops into one of the possible outcomes, there are ways that one can navigate through it and prepare for any other similar scenarios.
Fullerton recommended looking into owning an electric vehicle, especially given how the price of oil is expected to steadily increase over time. He added that if the use of electric or hybrid vehicles increases enough, it would drive the demand and, therefore, the price of gas down. 
According to Fullerton, some long-term remedy will have to come from adoption of electric vehicles, political agreements or economic deals with other oil producers. Regarding the short term, Fullerton emphasized that one should “prepare for possible short-run jumps upward” because they often happen without warning. 
Furthermore, Fullerton noted that students will not be too heavily impacted by rising gas prices because their lifestyle generally requires minimal driving. He explained that those who will be most impacted are people who live in more car-dependent areas like suburbs, which many students come from. Many citizens of Urbana-Champaign are dependent on cars as well, so they are liable to be impacted in the same way.
For University students, Fullerton suggested living closer to campus in an apartment within walking distance of stores and school, using a bike, getting an electric or hybrid vehicle, carpooling or utilizing public transport. 
Public transportation in Champaign-Urbana remains a popular option for students to travel around campus due to its availability and accessibility for students. The buses in Urbana-Champaign are designed to be fuel-efficient and sustainable, making them reliable and resilient during fuel-related economic situations.
Amy Snyder, MTD Chief of Staff, said that buses have not been very affected by the rise in gas prices because they run on diesel fuel, which is cheaper, and because most buses are hybrid. 
“Ninety-eight percent are hybrid and use batteries that are powered by a regenerative braking system, which results in a thirty to forty-five percent reduction of fuel consumption,” Snyder said.
There are 114 buses, four that run completely on diesel and will be retired by the end of the year and two hydrogen fuel cell electric buses powered by hydrogen that is made on site by solar power. The rest are hybrid, using a combination of diesel and regenerative braking.
Snyder added that buses are not very fast, averaging about 11 to 20 miles per hour, which means they don’t use a whole lot of fuel. 
The main problem to watch out for regarding buses is a workforce shortage. MTD is still recovering from the pandemic’s effects on the available workforce, so there are not enough bus operators to run at full capacity. Snyder said that there is “twenty percent less service and less frequencies on some routes.” 
The routes that will be affected in the coming school year are 22/220 Illini, 12 Teal Daytime, 13/130 Silver and 10 Gold, which will see less frequency. As advice to those interested in using public transport more often, Snyder said to plan fresh trips (meaning trips that aren’t planned from memory of routes in past years), use updated GPS real-time information available on the MTD app and website and sign up for an account on MTD, which allows users to get real-time updates.
Deltas emphasized that the situation taking place now with gas prices is nothing new and will inevitably be over soon and that there will be a return to some level of normalcy.
“If you go back to 1979 and 1980, the price per gallon is lower, but if you adjust the price for the purchasing power of the dollar, the price is not much higher than it was before,” Deltas said. “It’s an unpleasant experience, but the prices will go down; it doesn’t last very long. This will pass sooner than people think so we shouldn’t overreact.”  
Although the situation will pass, it is still part of the ongoing long-term trend of lessening supply and increasing demand, and it provides an insight into the effects of short-term surprise situations, which are liable to recur. 
“The general trend that people should expect in the long term is increase in the price of gasoline,” Fullerton said. “They shouldn’t be surprised if, in the long run, the price goes up to six or seven dollars a gallon.”

As you step outside, the sun shines down on you, and the air is humid. You start your journey with a small bag in hand and follow the long line of excited students that stretches from the Illini Union to Foellinger Auditorium — a walk you first took three years ago.
But this year, the walk is different, as you are a senior attending Quad Day for the last time. 
“Why would a senior go to Quad Day in the first place?” you might ask, wondering what the event could offer you. After all, you’ve done this several times already.
You arrived freshman year in 2019, your eyes bright at all the clubs you could possibly join that day. Then, in 2020, the pandemic struck, and Quad Day was virtual. Last fall, the event was held in person but was barely the same, especially if you were immunocompromised.
Now, it’s 2022. As a senior, you have one proper Quad Day left — an opportunity to go outside, enjoy the beautiful weather Champaign has to offer and look at the possible RSOs you could join during your final year. In fact, explore the RSOs you might have been unable to join these past three years due to prior time commitments.

While you’re exploring and navigating the Main Quad, visit your friends that are at tables for their own clubs. As you walk around and build up a sweat, go inside the Union for some air conditioning and purchase a poster for yourself at the poster sale. Choose something to spruce up your apartment.
Marvel at the incoming class and see how starry-eyed they are just as you once were. While you’re observing the freshmen and transfer students, help them out if you notice them struggling in the swarm of people — you may even make some new friends in the process. 
Don’t forget about free items and merch that organizations hand out on Quad Day. You might have plenty of pens and random stress balls, but you never know when you might misplace a pen. In addition, stress may arise in the future when the time to study for a midterm arrives, and that extra stress ball can help you focus and relax. 
Another free item that is common at Quad Day is the water bottle, which is especially useful for the hot, humid weather in Champaign-Urbana during the early months of the fall semester. Still, if free stress balls, pens and water bottles aren’t appealing, you can always scavenge for free candy at the event. 
Searching for free items could even lead you to find an RSO that excites you and would help you make the most of your final year in college.
Dustin Shattuck, advisor in the Division of General Studies, said seniors should look at RSOs that could provide quality experiences in the final year of college. Shattuck mentioned when he was a student at the University, he never missed a Quad Day. He said there was one specific item that always drew him back.
“That was always one of the draws for me — to get a free student planner,” Shattuck said.
During his senior-year Quad Day, Shattuck also kept an eye out for new groups that seemed like they would be fun or interesting. For example, he discovered an RSO that piqued his interest called the Pipe Club, as in a tobacco pipe club, where people would smoke tobacco pipes.
If you go to Quad Day as a senior, you’ll perhaps find an RSO just as interesting, if not more interesting, that has events throughout the school year.
Shattuck also enjoyed the energy Quad Day provided. During his time as a student at the University, Shattuck spent most of his summers on campus, which was a substantial change in pace from the regular semester. 
“It had a really good energy,” Shattuck said. “To go back into that fall semester and to see everyone back on campus and altogether in that way — it was sort of reinvigorating to start back into classes.”
Shattuck said one piece of advice he would provide seniors is to be present and conscious and appreciate the experience of being on campus before graduating. He also advised seniors to sign up for experiences and take an initiative within a community where they will learn, enjoy their time and meet new people.
When considering the opportunities that seniors can further pursue, whether through RSOs at Quad Day or otherwise, Shattuck emphasized the importance of the quality of the experiences over the quantity.
“I think the quality is the thing to really think about because that is what connects us and makes the experience real for us,” Shattuck said. “But when we’re trying to communicate to other people, the depth of that is certainly more important than just the title or saying you were involved in a whole bunch of things.”

A sea of bobbing heads spilled into Memorial Stadium, guided and greeted by volunteers dressed in the University’s signature orange. Volunteers passed out carrot-colored T-shirts, decorated in school symbols and chants. 
The incoming students donned their orange Illini Pride, initiating their journey with their new alma mater.
“I love the colors, I love the passion,” said Michael Przybyl, freshman in Engineering. “The culture’s energetic, I like it.”
The first of many events in the University’s Welcome Week, Illinois Sights & Sounds introduces students to the community they have joined. Through nonstop music, performances and videos, student energy levels kept climbing.
“I can see a bit more of the culture,” Przybyl said. “You don’t see that when you just move in and walk around town.”

Przybyl came to experience the event with a friend he made in his dorm, Parker Roeder, freshman in Engineering.
Roeder’s parents both went to the University, so he feels excited to be a part of the school, Roeder said. He looks forward to seeing the football games and wants to continue learning the University’s chants.
“I-L-L!” Roeder shouted.
Throughout the event, students performed on the field. A cappella singing prefaced the event before handing off the stage to Fighting Illini Cheerleading Team.
Dozens of orange and blue pom poms shook to capture the rhythm of the music while other cheerleaders danced across the field and lifted each other into the air.
Soon after, the Marching Illini covered the field, with hundreds of brass pieces glimmering in every direction.
The marching members formed into various shapes, including the word “Illini.”
Throughout the performance, an announcer taught students various Illinois chants. As he instructed students to stand up, they began holding each other and dancing together.
According to the University’s New Student website, Illinois Sights & Sounds teaches students “what it means to be an Illini and that (they), the student, are Illinois.”

On Monday, Champaign County held its annual Labor Day parade in downtown Champaign.
Starting at 10 a.m., several floats accompanied unions as they marched through the streets, throwing fistfuls of candy to children sitting on the curb. Marching bands from Urbana High School and Rantoul Township High School joined the festivities.
Soon after the parade, people went to West Side Park for a picnic. More than 250 people lined up for a meal provided by the city of Champaign.
At the picnic, there were bouncy houses and games for children as well as a live performance by The KTel’s, a Champaign-based band.
“We’re having a Labor Day parade to celebrate the hard-working people in Champaign County and everywhere else in the community,” said Matt Kelly, president of the Champaign County branch of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Kelly said he organized the event with the help of AFL-CIO’s vice president and executive board.
“We put the whole parade together,” Kelly said. “We got the food squared away, we got inflatables for the kids over at the park, we’ve got a band. We do all the outreach and coordination.”
According to Kelly, this is the largest event of the year for the labor community in Champaign County. The AFL-CIO president said people inside and outside of the labor community get excited for the parade, waiting to show their support for each other.
“That’s why there are so many folks that will be on the parade route cheering us on,” Kelly said. “And we cheer them on for cheering us on.”
During his 10-year tenure as president of AFL-CIO, Kelly said he has seen an increase in the public’s support for laborers.
“I think we’re seeing a renaissance now,” Kelly said. “People are starting to pay attention.”
Apathy and complacency still create issues within the labor community, according to Kelly. The president said some workers do not engage with the community at large, creating small groups that lack communication between each other.
“We get in our own little silos,” Kelly explained.
Kelly said the labor community must be diligent in order to maintain the wages and benefits that they have won over the years. 
“If you’re in labor, you’re constantly fighting against the pressures in society that want to minimize, take advantage of or minimize the work we do,” said Mike Sitch, co-president of the Champaign Federation of Teachers.
The Champaign County AFL-CIO invites the teacher’s union to participate in the parade every year, Sitch said. For each parade, the union tries to get as many members as it can to show up and demonstrate their solidarity.
“We’re here to show people that America’s made by working class people,” Sitch said.

Handheld Juneteenth fans offered to attendees of the Douglass Park Juneteenth celebration on Saturday

 June 19, 2023
Juneteenth, the United States federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved people, officially took place on Monday. The celebration of Juneteenth spanned several days across the Champaign-Urbana community. 
The occasion began with a flag raising ceremony in front of the Urbana city building on Friday and continued throughout the weekend to include community events, vendor fairs and various family-friendly activities throughout the area. 
Darius White, an Urbana economic development coordinator, said Juneteenth celebrations included parades, concerts, community events, educational programs and opportunities for family and social gatherings.
“These celebrations are influenced by the diverse history and tradition of black communities across the country and serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and justice,” White said.
All non-essential federal offices were closed for the federal holiday, enabling many employees to take a three-day weekend. 

Although Juneteenth was only made an official holiday by the federal government in 2021, its existence as a significant date for the Black community traces its roots back to 1865.

A newspaper clipping from June 21, 1865 announcing the freeing of enslaved people in Galveston, TX.
By Lisa Chasanov, Summer Editor
On June 19, 1865, Union general Gordon Granger informed a group of previously enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas of their newly afforded citizenship and freedom. This address came approximately two months after Confederate general Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union forces in Appomattox, Virginia — and well over two years after Abraham Lincoln’s signature of the Emancipation Proclamation.
The National Museum of African American History & Culture at the Smithsonian Institute describes Juneteenth as “our country’s second independence day,” highlighting the fact that the independence of the United States excluded enslaved individuals in its guarantees of certain rights to its citizens.
Although Juneteenth marked the inclusion of Black people as citizens of the United States, there remained a long and arduous path toward equity for all. 
“The post-emancipation period known as Reconstruction marked an era of great hope, uncertainty, and struggle for the nation as a whole,” reads the Smithsonian article regarding the holiday. “Formerly enslaved people immediately sought to reunify families, establish schools, run for political office, push radical legislation and even sue slaveholders for compensation.”
158 years following the emancipation of enslaved people in Texas on June 19, 1865, White said that community members still fight for justice every day. 

“We are also reminded that freedom is something that we should never take for granted,” White said in his address at the Juneteenth flag raising on Friday. “We all must strive to break down barriers that impede the progress of equality. We must remember our past so that we do not repeat it and we can build a better future for ourselves and future generations.”

Raising of the Juneteenth flag in Urbana on Friday
By Lisa Chasanov, Summer Editor
On Friday, the city of Urbana hosted a Juneteenth flag raising at the Urbana City building. The event was intended to mark the official observance of the holiday in the city of Urbana with speeches from Urbana city officials.
The Juneteenth flag, which features the colors of the American flag and one bright star in the center surrounded by a white burst, commemorates the emancipation of all enslaved individuals in the United States. 
At Friday’s event, the Juneteenth flag was raised alongside the American and Illinois state flags in front of the building.
Speeches from city officials highlighted the history of both the flag and the holiday. 
“The celebration of Juneteenth dates back to 1866,” said Femi Fletcher, human resources and finance official at the city of Urbana. “The flag is raised here today (in recognition) of what this day means for our friends, our neighbors, our ancestors and our nation.”

A central theme of this event was collective progress as a society and the ongoing struggle for liberation. Fletcher discussed the 13th amendment and its ratification across all 50 states. In her speech, Fletcher highlighted several states which passed the amendment in recent years — including Mississippi, which ratified in 2013. 
The event was also marked with a reading of the mayoral proclamation of Juneteenth’s official observance in Urbana.
“Therefore I, Diane Wolfe Marlin, mayor of the city of Urbana, do hereby proclaim June 19th, 2023 as Juneteenth in Urbana, to be celebrated proudly throughout the community,” read Marlin’s proclamation.

By Lisa Chasanov, Summer Editor
On Saturday, community members gathered at Douglass Park in Champaign to celebrate Juneteenth. The event was marketed as a fun and exciting summer celebration with live music and small local vendors.
Individuals from university agencies, libraries, small businesses and community organizations offered their time and services at the event.
At the event’s stage, visitors enjoyed performances from a wide range of local musicians — ranging from a drum collective and jazz combo to youth performers — as well as a raffle for attendees which could be entered by providing a donation.
Several local black-owned businesses featured their handmade products including clothing, jewelry, perfume and accessories.
The event highlighted and uplifted the Black community in Champaign-Urbana and brought together diverse individuals from across the area.

While the flag raising sought to bring awareness to the history and significance of Juneteenth, the Douglass Park celebration seemed to engage its visitors through dancing, food, music and a sense of community.

 June 19, 2023
Juneteenth, the United States federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved people, officially took place on Monday. The celebration of Juneteenth spanned several days across the Champaign-Urbana community. 
The occasion began with a flag raising ceremony in front of the Urbana city building on Friday and continued throughout the weekend to include community events, vendor fairs and various family-friendly activities throughout the area. 
Darius White, an Urbana economic development coordinator, said Juneteenth celebrations included parades, concerts, community events, educational programs and opportunities for family and social gatherings.
“These celebrations are influenced by the diverse history and tradition of black communities across the country and serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and justice,” White said.
All non-essential federal offices were closed for the federal holiday, enabling many employees to take a three-day weekend. 

Although Juneteenth was only made an official holiday by the federal government in 2021, its existence as a significant date for the Black community traces its roots back to 1865.

On June 19, 1865, Union general Gordon Granger informed a group of previously enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas of their newly afforded citizenship and freedom. This address came approximately two months after Confederate general Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union forces in Appomattox, Virginia — and well over two years after Abraham Lincoln’s signature of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Although it is now lined with freshly built luxury student apartment buildings, Champaign’s University Avenue is also paved with regional significance dating as far back as 1940. 
Barbara Suggs-Mason, co-chair of the Champaign County African American Heritage Trail, said University Avenue has long served as the unofficial border between the University’s campus and Champaign’s North End, a region traditionally occupied by the twin cities’ African American community.
“Segregation in Champaign-Urbana has been progressive — meaning that back in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when there were few African Americans in the community, it was not necessarily segregated,” Mason said. “As the population of African Americans increased, it didn’t matter whether you were a teacher or a laborer — you lived north of University Avenue, with few exceptions.”
According to an archival study by University urban planning doctorate alum Natalie Prochaska, a report from the local League of Women Voters found that the population of Black residents of Champaign-Urbana quadrupled between 1940 and 1968. This period is when the patterns of segregation grew more evident in previously progressive Champaign, Mason said.
“Those housing patterns were everywhere — it resegregated and (the North End) became known as the Black area,” Mason explained. “Working class whites moved either west to places like Garden Hills or to other new subdivisions. They had covenants (with the local government) where they were not to sell to Black people.”

Mason explained this pattern was somewhat reversed by the employment of Black professors at the University starting in the late 1960s.
“Today, housing is more open than it was before,” Mason said. “It began to open up when the University of Illinois started recruiting (Black) professionals for the campus and people demanded quality housing in quality areas.”
While this movement eventually succeeded in integrating certain areas, Mason explained that affiliation with the University afforded an exclusive group of Black residents access to previously unavailable housing.
“African American people were being employed in those positions at the University and it was kind of known in the community that they were,” Mason explained. “It was increasing. I’m not going to tell you it was huge, but compared to what it had been, it was better.”
According to Mason, the University likely had power in determining whether or not a Black employee would have access to previously unavailable or predominantly white neighborhoods.
“Some individuals and their families could afford to move into what you might want to call white spaces and they were open to them,” Mason said. “I don’t know all of the inside track in terms of how the University of Illinois helped to get them into those spaces, but I imagine (University affiliation) certainly helped.”
Andrew Greenlee, professor in FAA, explained the University often had more impact on housing and segregation patterns throughout the area than even local government due to its stake in land and development.
“As urban planners, we think of universities and other large institutions as being urban developers,” Greenlee noted. “The University holds a large amount of property and plays a large role in that. It’s important when we think about those patterns, we can think about the roles of the local governments and the county and that we think about the role that the University has played over time.”
Greenlee reiterated the importance of University Avenue as a line in discussions surrounding the boundaries of Champaign’s historic North End, noting the residential separation between communities still exists.
The Champaign County African American Heritage Trail serves the area as a reminder of the areas that have been underscored with significance for the local African American community, outlining significant sites across the region.
Greenlee said there are likely reasons other than segregation at play when discussing why community members continue to live on the North End rather than moving into now-integrated housing.
“It’s kind of tough to capture the story or the reasons why people might be choosing to live in some of those places and to separate that out from a lack of choice,” Greenlee explained. “Understanding the mix of those factors or what underlies them now is a lot more challenging to diagnose than it is to kind of think about this across history.”
According to Mason, the blurring of boundaries between the North End and predominantly white areas of Champaign-Urbana has not caused the local Black population to identify with their historic neighborhoods any less.
“You have people who live now on the southwest side of town, but they still drive to the north end to go to church,” Mason said. “It’s important to feel like a part of the community.”

Sumo wrestlers, firefighters, pirates and medieval knights: On Saturday, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts offered people the chance to slip between different outfits and professions.
Within 10 minutes of the sale opening, every aisle rang with the sound of hangers clacking together. People pulled out clothing in a range of fabric types and colors.
“Am I looking for anything specific?” said Kylie Maurer, a Bloomington-Normal resident. “No, it’s just a whimsical Saturday activity.” 
While Maurer tried clothes on, her friend gathered more clothes that they might like. Within 10 minutes of arriving, they had created mounds of clothes to sift through.
“We love a rummage sale, and so I saw this, and I needed some good in my day,” Maurer said. “So, I forced my friend to come over at 7 a.m. to jump in the car and drive.”

Maurer said she came to the event hoping to find a good corset or pair of pants, but soon saw the sale as a “participatory gallery experience.”
“I love fun weird things like this,” Maurer said. “What a treat to be able to do something so delightful.”
The Krannert Center Costume and Prop Sale happens every two years, said Kira Lyon, assistant properties and rentals director at KCPA.
Many of the costumes and props sold were either donated or made by students, Lyon said.
“(The University) is one of the few programs that has an MFA degree for props,” Lyon said. “We have graduate students take classes from welding to upholstery, scenic painting, history of architecture and decor.”
As students complete their coursework and donations come in, a lot of assets start piling up, Lyon said. To ensure the Krannert Center has room for new pieces, they sell their old props and costumes.
“We’ll go through and see anything that might not be worth repairing,” Lyon said. “But most of it is stuff that we just haven’t used in a long time.”
In preparation for the event, the KCPA put up posters and posted it on their social media, she said. They also put an ad on Craigslist, but Lyon said she did not worry about the turnout.
“People get really excited about this event,” Lyon said. “When we get the word out, people are ready.”

Once upon a time, we used to trust artists. Now, we anticipate disappointment. 
There is a certain joy to be found in waiting for a favorite content creator to lay another golden egg. But perhaps that is the problem altogether — art has become content, and we the consumers drive its steady flow, not the other way around.
In no fair and just world would conglomerates like the Walt Disney Company churn out an endless slew of spin-offs, sequels and unnecessary narrative appendages to their media franchises, such as Star Wars, if they didn’t value the consumer’s endless appetite over the quality of their product.
All large-scale franchises started as sparks of inspiration that grew into their own small, contained stories. But the inspiration and passion behind the stories only dim as their fiscal value is repeatedly taken advantage of.
Imagination sells, but at a grave cost.

Especially in the realms of film and television, the term “product” does not have to be synonymous with “mediocre.” It seems as though audiences have grown to expect to be inundated with content rather than waiting for something worthwhile. 
It is in this sad mindset that we always forget about imagination.
It’s that wonderful tool many of us tossed aside one day and let it rust over. Imagination is creativity at its most personal — drawing on a person’s psyche to produce not only with genuine thought behind it but also with tangible humanity. 
In theory, this is all cut and dry: Let the big media companies learn their lesson from both critical and streaming losses, and let smaller indie companies with real passion behind them take the reins of the industry.
But this is merely centered on cinema. There is a larger deficit of imagination, and that begins with us. It should not just be creators who use their individual and colorful minds. 
This does not apply solely to children, as the word “imagination” is likely to conjure the image of a toddler sitting on the classroom floor over a blank piece of paper with a fistful of crayons. 
Simple everyday adults especially should be using their imaginations on a regular basis. Surprisingly, it’s boring, old grown-ups who have the most active imaginations. It makes sense. They have more experiences, more desires and overall, a more developed worldview than someone who still has to raise their hand to use the restroom.
The real issue with this imagination deficit is not that it’s lacking in what we consume, but that we too often forget to use it ourselves. There’s nothing wrong with losing oneself in flights of fancy on a daily basis. In fact, it can give valuable insights to one’s desires and worries.
The sad truth, however, is that the simple ability to let one’s mind have its own little recess has become commoditized. We see this throughout the media landscape, especially with the constant deluge of content across streaming platforms.
Too often do we complain about the hordes of mediocre content to be found across platforms like Netflix and Disney+, only to unanimously celebrate when a special something emerges that has competent writing and direction.
This shouldn’t have to be a rare occurrence. 
The most publicized example of this is found again with the Star Wars of recent years. First came the inundation of mediocre content that rode the waves of nostalgia bait and manipulation of fan’s expectations, as in the cases of Obi-Wan Kenobi and The Book of Boba Fett.
But then emerged Andor, a television miniseries with only the most minor connections to a larger convoluted narrative. It focused on original characters with intentional writing and development behind them — the tangible bit of humanity was shining through the cracks. 
This being said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying any piece of media, no matter what any critic, online pundit or makeshift media journalist behind a two-bit microphone has to say about its inherent value.
This columnist admits a strong love for things one might consider “throwaway content” like unironically intense cooking competitions on the Food Network. In addition, this columnist has seen most of the recent miniseries of a certain large comic-book franchise — and has found at least some genuine enjoyment in all of them.
However, stories with true imagination and passion behind them will always be welcomed more warmly by audiences. We love stories because they are, at the end of the day, about all of us.
A story written by a human, not a company, is what truly touches our hearts. And it’s in our own powers to tell them — all we have to do is let our minds wander, even for a blissful moment.

’Tis the season of pastel pink hearts, chocolates in heart-shaped boxes and adorable plushies. These items prominently line the shelves of stores while a million voices cry out, “I’m free on February 14th.” But amid all of the romantic pressure of the holiday, we want to remind you that it’s OK to spend Valentine’s Day with yourself.
If you find yourself “needing” a date for Valentine’s Day, you’re not alone.
In fact, this pressure to find a date underscores an altogether bigger issue: How college dating and hookup culture pressures individuals into having regrettable sex to find belonging.
For many of us, attending a university coincides with the point in our lives where we are given monumental freedoms that we have never experienced before. The knee-jerk reaction is to chase these highs without any concern for what we really want. How many doe-eyed freshmen go to parties looking for the love of their life only to be disappointed by the results?
We’re not saying that you shouldn’t participate in hookups or dating culture, so long as you enjoy it and practice it safely. The act itself is not the problem.

The issue comes from the toxic aspects of college culture that make you feel as though you need to participate in hookup and dating culture. For example, some fraternities and sororities on campus regularly shame their brothers and sisters for not having sex.
But you don’t have to be in Greek life to be subjected to this kind of teasing. Boasting about sexual conquests and shaming others for lacking experience or interest is far too common online. The result? Feelings of inadequacy and estrangement.
This kind of language is symptomatic of our society that associates sex with status. The idea of this is that those who have sex and are able to “pull” a variety of different partners are superior to those who do not or choose not to. This way of thinking is inherently flawed.
Valentine’s Day comes from contentious origins — be it martyred priests or pagan fertility rituals. But this time of year has always been about sending romantic cards and lovemaking, and as everyone scrambles to find a date, the true meaning of love can get lost in translation.
In our society, the act of love is a paradox. When we rush into relationships, we often don’t stop to consider whether we’re mature enough to love at all. Broken hearts are not uncommon around Valentine’s Day.
Instead, you should love at your own pace and enter the dating scene when you feel ready to do so.
If you find yourself dateless on Valentine’s Day, fret not — there are a variety of different things you can do on campus that do not require a date. You could get your friends together and plan a movie night where you laugh at a rom-com. You could take yourself out on a date to a restaurant you’ve never been to before (we recommend making a reservation first).
If neither of these options suit you, then there’s nothing wrong with snuggling up on the couch with some cheap candy, putting on a movie you like and enjoying your own company.
This Valentine’s Day, we challenge you to fall in love with yourself. You might learn a thing or two about loving others.

Dear University students, both incoming and returning: You have made an expert choice of institution, and I hope you are proud.
I write to you now as a dusty old alum, and I thought I would share with you a few things about this place I wish I’d known sooner. Forgive me for beginning bitterly, but I consider it a crime worthy of high annoyance not to have been told about two items in particular. 
 
1. Nap Pods
That’s right. Look no further; the future of public napping is here. On the third floor of the Sidney Lu Mechanical Engineering Building, you will find covered pods meant for students in need of a quick snooze. Picture a motorcycle helmet for your whole body, complete with a reclining bench and an alarm to jolt you awake.

As a poor sleeper, I know the value of a midday emergency nap. I resigned myself long ago to the hard wooden benches of the main library’s third floor, where one’s backpack becomes a pillow and one’s coat a blanket. You can imagine my indignation after observing that mildly humiliating ritual several times a week for multiple years upon learning there was a better way. 
 
2. Nick Offerman
Not the man behind Ron Swanson himself, but the way his legacy is communicated on this campus. You may have heard — eagerly whispered through your own alumni channels or shouted at you through a megaphone on your campus visit tour — of the beloved Nick Offerman bench. 
If you have not, you have extra homework. Located under a gazebo just a short walk inside the Japan House gardens in Urbana, you will find a lovely wooden seat hand-crafted by Offerman himself and dedicated to his teacher at the University, sensei Shozo Sato. It’s a great place to think and absorb the gardens’ serenity. 
While I would never question Offerman’s woodwork, the bench is not the most interesting Offerman-related attraction in Champaign-Urbana. 
As I was told just last week by a trusted advisor, there is a bar in downtown Champaign (what bar?) that runs a video loop of Nick Offerman, sitting fireside, Scotch swirling in hand. 
Like the blooming of the Japan House’s cherry blossoms, the bar’s Swanson-sighting is only seasonal, offering just a narrow window for drinking in its sublime aesthetic.
That season happens to be winter, meaning I can only recommend this spot on the strength of its reputation and obvious spellbinding power. Given that for four years, my cop-out answer to the perennial “What’s on your UIUC bucket list?” question was to visit the Nick Offerman bench, I took the news of this virtual scotch Swanson hologram with a grimace. 
 
I suppose I shouldn’t sulk too much. Perhaps this is what I get for not being an engineer, or not looking at Reddit – where the best and worst of the University’s intellectual output collide. It may already be obvious to the reader that I am the kind of person who catches on to things late. Suffice it to say, others are not solely to blame for my missing out.
So, dearest new arrivals and returning scholars, I hope you will take these words as a reminder to enjoy this great campus and to explore early and often. Pause to admire the Main Quad on a crisp Champaign spring or Urbana autumn day and take in all those other sites of future nostalgia. Treat yourself to an Illini Blizzard at the Altgeld Hall Dairy Queen once in a while. 
But don’t feel pressured; my message is hopeful too. Even in my last semester on this campus, I still found fresh delight in the University’s hidden wonders. As you begin your time here, I wish you growth and fulfillment in your stay. Have fun, save the environment and write for The DI.

Jack Larson
An aerial view of the Main Quad on May 9.
Dear University students, both incoming and returning: You have made an expert choice of institution, and I hope you are proud.
I write to you now as a dusty old alum, and I thought I would share with you a few things about this place I wish I’d known sooner. Forgive me for beginning bitterly, but I consider it a crime worthy of high annoyance not to have been told about two items in particular. 
 
1. Nap Pods
That’s right. Look no further; the future of public napping is here. On the third floor of the Sidney Lu Mechanical Engineering Building, you will find covered pods meant for students in need of a quick snooze. Picture a motorcycle helmet for your whole body, complete with a reclining bench and an alarm to jolt you awake.
As a poor sleeper, I know the value of a midday emergency nap. I resigned myself long ago to the hard wooden benches of the main library’s third floor, where one’s backpack becomes a pillow and one’s coat a blanket. You can imagine my indignation after observing that mildly humiliating ritual several times a week for multiple years upon learning there was a better way. 
 
2. Nick Offerman
Not the man behind Ron Swanson himself, but the way his legacy is communicated on this campus. You may have heard — eagerly whispered through your own alumni channels or shouted at you through a megaphone on your campus visit tour — of the beloved Nick Offerman bench. 
If you have not, you have extra homework. Located under a gazebo just a short walk inside the Japan House gardens in Urbana, you will find a lovely wooden seat hand-crafted by Offerman himself and dedicated to his teacher at the University, sensei Shozo Sato. It’s a great place to think and absorb the gardens’ serenity. 
While I would never question Offerman’s woodwork, the bench is not the most interesting Offerman-related attraction in Champaign-Urbana. 
As I was told just last week by a trusted advisor, there is a bar in downtown Champaign (what bar?) that runs a video loop of Nick Offerman, sitting fireside, Scotch swirling in hand. 
Like the blooming of the Japan House’s cherry blossoms, the bar’s Swanson-sighting is only seasonal, offering just a narrow window for drinking in its sublime aesthetic.
That season happens to be winter, meaning I can only recommend this spot on the strength of its reputation and obvious spellbinding power. Given that for four years, my cop-out answer to the perennial “What’s on your UIUC bucket list?” question was to visit the Nick Offerman bench, I took the news of this virtual scotch Swanson hologram with a grimace. 
 
I suppose I shouldn’t sulk too much. Perhaps this is what I get for not being an engineer, or not looking at Reddit – where the best and worst of the University’s intellectual output collide. It may already be obvious to the reader that I am the kind of person who catches on to things late. Suffice it to say, others are not solely to blame for my missing out.
So, dearest new arrivals and returning scholars, I hope you will take these words as a reminder to enjoy this great campus and to explore early and often. Pause to admire the Main Quad on a crisp Champaign spring or Urbana autumn day and take in all those other sites of future nostalgia. Treat yourself to an Illini Blizzard at the Altgeld Hall Dairy Queen once in a while. 
But don’t feel pressured; my message is hopeful too. Even in my last semester on this campus, I still found fresh delight in the University’s hidden wonders. As you begin your time here, I wish you growth and fulfillment in your stay. Have fun, save the environment and write for The DI.

With less than a month to go until Illinois men’s basketball tips off at State Farm Center, the program hosted its annual media day to provide the inside scoop on the team. Head coach Brad Underwood kicked off the proceedings with a press conference in which he gave insights into where the 2023-24 Illini are currently at.
One thing Underwood made sure to stress was the fitness and sheer athleticism found within this current squad. In describing the team’s successful workouts with strength and conditioning coach Adam Fletcher, Underwood boldly stated how the 2023-24 Illini rank compared to previous years.
“The most important thing is the time with (Fletcher) in the weight room and conditioning,” Underwood said. “It has been, without question, and I think if (Fletcher) was here, he would tell you, this has been the best we’ve ever had in terms of that.”
Illinois has certainly been putting in the work this offseason, highlighted by fifth-year guard Justin Harmon breaking the program record for the fastest mile time previously held by former Illini Jacob Grandison and Trent Frazier. Harmon’s pace was described as “getting on a treadmill and setting it to about 12.8” for a full mile.
“This is an ultra, ultra-competitive group, and little things, mile times, we all have it as part of our conditioning tests,” Underwood said. “Usually, most people just try to get through that. There’s a lot of complaining about ‘well, we’re not a track team’ or this or that. They shared their all trying to shatter records, and it’s been a very mature, competitive group.”


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Underwood had high praise for the depth and experience of the roster, a reassuring sign for Illini fans heading into the 2023-24 season. During its successful trip to Spain during the summer, Illinois was able to rotate the team and spread minutes across the squad.
“It was fantastic on every front,” Underwood said regarding the team’s time in Spain. “We had a great group of donors go, travel was great, we had incredible weather every day, everybody had fun and enjoyed it, and the basketball was pretty good as well.”
After kicking off the trip with a hard-fought 84-73 victory over the Madrid All-Stars, Illinois went on to secure two more extremely lopsided 105-60 and 103-69 wins against Valencia and the Catalonia All-Stars, respectively. While fifth-year forward Marcus Domask missed out due to injury, the rest of the Illini were able to get substantial time on the floor during their time overseas.
Regarding leadership, Illinois has a lot of experience under its belt, with Harmon, Domask, fifth-year guard Terrence Shannon Jr., senior forward Coleman Hawkins and fifth-year forward Quincy Guerrier all rostered for the coming year. With both Shannon and Hawkins returning after going through the NBA draft process over the past few months, the duo will be looked upon by teammates and fans alike to step up and serve as leaders on the court at State Farm Center. There is going to be a plethora of experience on the floor for Underwood’s team.
It comes as a significant turnaround from last season, where Underwood and the Illini had the opposite become reality: taking a young, inexperienced, overall new-look squad into the battlegrounds of NCAA basketball.
It won’t be long until Illinois returns to action, with the team preparing for a return to State Farm Center on Oct. 20 to welcome Ottawa to Champaign for an exhibition game. After a strong summer and an optimistic Underwood, Illini fans have reasons to hope for a memorable year of Illinois basketball.

The Illini cross country teams finally had another chance to compete at the Big Ten Championships this season on Friday in State College, Pennsylvania, after five regular-season meets.
The men’s and women’s teams both took home sixth place behind other conference opponents such as Michigan State, Indiana, Wisconsin, which placed fifth, fourth and first, respectively. 
The sixth-place overall finish marks the second year in a row for the men’s team and the second time in three years for the women.
Head coach Sarah Haveman came into this year’s postseason with high expectations for both teams, especially the women’s team, which managed to take home third place at last season’s Big Ten Championships and advanced to the NCAA Championships, where they finished 22nd overall. 
Graduate student Jon Davis is familiar with these high stakes postseason environments and continued his hot streak this season by finishing third overall with a time of 24:44.0 as the Illini’s first finisher in the men’s 5.2-mile race.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Davis is looking to return to the next round of the cross country postseason for the second year in a row after being the only male runner representing the Illini at the NCAA Championships last season, when he placed 39th overall with All-American honors.
Underclassmen from both programs had some strong performances during their respective meets. At least one underclassmen runner finished in the top two for the Illini during both races.
On the women’s side, freshman Annalyssa Crain placed 17th overall with a time of 21:11.0 as her team’s first finisher. Senior Emma Milburn finished shortly after and placed 19th overall with a time of 21:13.5.
Sophomore Tyler Cushing managed to finish 12th for the men with a time of 25:13.0. After an initial struggle adapting to the challenges of COVID-19 in the beginning of his career, Cushing managed to play a big role on the men’s team during one of the biggest meets of the season.
The list of qualifying runners that will advance to the next round of the postseason is expected to be released in the following week, while several Illini from both programs remain hopeful to be listed after their strong performances at the Big Ten Championships.
The NCAA Regional is scheduled for Nov. 12 in Iowa City, Iowa.

For the second time in 2023, Illinois football played on Friday evening instead of the usual Saturday, hosting the Nebraska Cornhuskers and first-year head coach Matt Rhule. A day earlier, the high was 75 degrees and partly cloudy, but at kickoff on Friday, the weather became a major talking point as wind gusts hovered around 25 miles per hour with temperatures in the high 40s. 
With the Big Ten schedule fully underway, the programs faced off with the hopes of earning their first conference win, especially after both were trounced a week prior. The Illini entered off a 44-19 loss in West Lafayette, Indiana, while the Cornhuskers were out clashed at home in a 45-7 loss to the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines. However, the visiting Cornhuskers came out on top in stunning fashion by a score of 20-7. 
Before the game, the teams paid tribute to former Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus, who died at the age of 80 a day prior. Throughout the game, the stadium played highlights and tributes to the Illini Athletics Hall of Famer. In a statement released on Thursday, head coach Bret Bielema spoke highly of the late Illini legend.
 “As the head coach of his alma mater that he loved, I had the great honor to meet Dick, one of my childhood idols, last September,” Bielema said. “He was an amazing person, as well as football player and a loyal Illini.”
The game kicked off with a familiar tone, as Illinois once again started with the ball after Nebraska deferred to the second half. This marks the sixth straight time since the beginning of the season where the Illini started the game on offense. 


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer and the offense marched down the field on a six-minute drive that made it all the way to the Nebraska goalline. However, the Cornhuskers defense held strong, stuffing junior running back Reggie Love short of the touchdown. 
“It gets to the point of ridiculousness,” Bielema said. “It’s absolutely maddening to not put it in from the one-foot line, I can’t describe how frustrated I am.”
Nebraska responded with some deep passes to get into Illinois territory, driving 86 yards before kicking a field goal to take a 3-0 lead late in the first quarter. The ensuing Illini drive went absolutely nowhere, aside from a holding penalty on the defense, which was the only first down they earned.
The Illini defense forced a quick three-and-out, returning the ball to their offense to start the second quarter. The Illini offense once again did nothing, forcing them to punt after gaining just two yards. 
Nebraska came out on offense and started driving again, aided by a facemask penalty on the Illinois defense. The Cornhuskers went for it on fourth and five at midfield, converting for a first down inside Illini territory before eventually getting into the endzone to take a 10-0 lead. The scoring drive lasted over six minutes and took 14 plays.
The Illini desperately needed points on the following drive, but that drive never occurred. The kickoff following Nebraska’s touchdown was short, and a lack of communication led to a recovery by the kicking team at the Illinois 25-yard line. Nebraska immediately punched it in for a touchdown, taking a 17-0 lead in front of a stunned and embarrassed Illinois crowd, which started to make its way toward the exits halfway through the second quarter.
After a three and out by both offenses, Altmyer got another chance in the first half, with points being critical to staying in the game. Altmyer threw a dime to junior wide receiver Pat Bryant for a 46-yard touchdown that made it a 17-7 game with 91 seconds to go in the half. Illinois had another drive with 40 seconds left but couldn’t get anything out of it as the teams headed into the locker room with Nebraska leading 17-7.
Both teams came out of the locker room with a lot at stake, as the Illini defense stopped Nebraska from padding the lead. The Illini offense came on the field and converted a third and long on a catch and run from junior tight end Griffin Moore. However, Moore was popped from behind and coughed up the ball as Nebraska took possession deep in Illinois territory.
Nebraska went ahead and put up a field goal on the drive, taking a 20-7 lead halfway through the third quarter. Illinois proceeded to lose nine yards on first down, one yard on second down and throw an incomplete pass on third down, which necessitated another punt. The punt was blocked by Nebraska, giving the visitors excellent field position, but not before the referees issued a sideline warning.
The Cornhuskers missed a 36-yard field goal, giving Illini fans some hope as they watched their team trail 20-7. However, the Illini offense did nothing again, forcing a tired defense to take the field. The Cornhuskers got all the way to the Illini 12, before fumbling the ball. Illinois’ offense went three and out, punting it away again.
Senior offensive lineman Isaiah Adams spoke about how to recover from losses like this, talking about putting personal feelings aside in order to help the young players.
“(I) spend a lot of time with my family and (try to) stick with the guys,” Adams said. “Gotta lean on your brothers through this tough time and the other captains.”
The defense came up with an interception for the Illini, giving Altmyer and company another opportunity. The offense did not take advantage, as the story remained the same, this time an underthrown pass by Altmyer was easily picked off by Nebraska. The Cornhuskers salted away much of the remaining clock and picked up a big win.

Before the game, the teams paid tribute to former Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus, who died at the age of 80 a day prior. Throughout the game, the stadium played highlights and tributes to the Illini Athletics Hall of Famer. In a statement released on Thursday, head coach Bret Bielema spoke highly of the late Illini legend.
 “As the head coach of his alma mater that he loved, I had the great honor to meet Dick, one of my childhood idols, last September,” Bielema said. “He was an amazing person, as well as football player and a loyal Illini.”
The game kicked off with a familiar tone, as Illinois once again started with the ball after Nebraska deferred to the second half. This marks the sixth straight time since the beginning of the season where the Illini started the game on offense.

Sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer and the offense marched down the field on a six-minute drive that made it all the way to the Nebraska goalline. However, the Cornhuskers defense held strong, stuffing junior running back Reggie Love short of the touchdown. 
“It gets to the point of ridiculousness,” Bielema said. “It’s absolutely maddening to not put it in from the one-foot line, I can’t describe how frustrated I am.”
Nebraska responded with some deep passes to get into Illinois territory, driving 86 yards before kicking a field goal to take a 3-0 lead late in the first quarter. The ensuing Illini drive went absolutely nowhere, aside from a holding penalty on the defense, which was the only first down they earned.
The Illini defense forced a quick three-and-out, returning the ball to their offense to start the second quarter. The Illini offense once again did nothing, forcing them to punt after gaining just two yards. 
Nebraska came out on offense and started driving again, aided by a facemask penalty on the Illinois defense. The Cornhuskers went for it on fourth and five at midfield, converting for a first down inside Illini territory before eventually getting into the endzone to take a 10-0 lead. The scoring drive lasted over six minutes and took 14 plays.
The Illini desperately needed points on the following drive, but that drive never occurred. The kickoff following Nebraska’s touchdown was short, and a lack of communication led to a recovery by the kicking team at the Illinois 25-yard line. Nebraska immediately punched it in for a touchdown, taking a 17-0 lead in front of a stunned and embarrassed Illinois crowd, which started to make its way toward the exits halfway through the second quarter.
After a three and out by both offenses, Altmyer got another chance in the first half, with points being critical to staying in the game. Altmyer threw a dime to junior wide receiver Pat Bryant for a 46-yard touchdown that made it a 17-7 game with 91 seconds to go in the half. Illinois had another drive with 40 seconds left but couldn’t get anything out of it as the teams headed into the locker room with Nebraska leading 17-7.
Both teams came out of the locker room with a lot at stake, as the Illini defense stopped Nebraska from padding the lead. The Illini offense came on the field and converted a third and long on a catch and run from junior tight end Griffin Moore. However, Moore was popped from behind and coughed up the ball as Nebraska took possession deep in Illinois territory.
Nebraska went ahead and put up a field goal on the drive, taking a 20-7 lead halfway through the third quarter. Illinois proceeded to lose nine yards on first down, one yard on second down and throw an incomplete pass on third down, which necessitated another punt. The punt was blocked by Nebraska, giving the visitors excellent field position, but not before the referees issued a sideline warning.
The Cornhuskers missed a 36-yard field goal, giving Illini fans some hope as they watched their team trail 20-7. However, the Illini offense did nothing again, forcing a tired defense to take the field. The Cornhuskers got all the way to the Illini 12, before fumbling the ball. Illinois’ offense went three and out, punting it away again.
Senior offensive lineman Isaiah Adams spoke about how to recover from losses like this, talking about putting personal feelings aside in order to help the young players.
“(I) spend a lot of time with my family and (try to) stick with the guys,” Adams said. “Gotta lean on your brothers through this tough time and the other captains.”
The defense came up with an interception for the Illini, giving Altmyer and company another opportunity. The offense did not take advantage, as the story remained the same, this time an underthrown pass by Altmyer was easily picked off by Nebraska. The Cornhuskers salted away much of the remaining clock and picked up a big win.

Junior wide receiver Pat Bryant celebrates in the south endzone after scoring the Illini's only touchdown of the game in the second quarter against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on Friday, Oct. 6 at Memorial Stadium. Bryant had four receptions for 76 yards.
For the second time in 2023, Illinois football played on Friday evening instead of the usual Saturday, hosting the Nebraska Cornhuskers and first-year head coach Matt Rhule. A day earlier, the high was 75 degrees and partly cloudy, but at kickoff on Friday, the weather became a major talking point as wind gusts hovered around 25 miles per hour with temperatures in the high 40s. 
With the Big Ten schedule fully underway, the programs faced off with the hopes of earning their first conference win, especially after both were trounced a week prior. The Illini entered off a 44-19 loss in West Lafayette, Indiana, while the Cornhuskers were out clashed at home in a 45-7 loss to the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines.

Friday night lights are back in Champaign for a Big Ten showdown. The Nebraska Cornhuskers (2-3, 0-2) are in town in a matchup of struggling teams with identical records. The Illini (2-3,0-2) are returning home, desperate to get back on track for their bowl game goals.
The Cornhuskers entered the 2023 season as an intriguing team with many new faces. Head coach Matt Rhule had an unsuccessful tenure in the NFL, amassing an 11-27 record across three seasons before being fired by the Carolina Panthers. He returned to college football this year, but things have not gone according to plan.
Rhule’s impressive turnaround with the Baylor Bears enticed some talented freshmen and transfers, including former five-star tight end Arik Gilbert, to come to Lincoln. The tight end hasn’t gotten a snap yet, however, after he was arrested twice in one week leading up to the season.
The disappearance of Gilbert may not have affected the results thus far, but they certainly set the tone around the program. 4-star transfer quarterback Jeff Sims was highly regarded in the offseason, coming to Lincoln from the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Sims was quickly benched, however, after turning the ball over six times in two games.
Sophomore quarterback Heinrich Haarberg took over the offense and has led the team to a 2-1 record since Sims was removed. Haarberg has only thrown for 477 yards in three games on 52% completion, but four touchdowns and only one interception solidifies him as the starter going forward.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Defensively, the Cornhuskers have been solid for a losing football team. Three of their five opponents didn’t eclipse 14 points, and the powerhouse Colorado Buffalo offense had only scored 13 points through 38 minutes. Field position from offensive turnovers and fatigue set in for the remainder of that game, but the only offense to truly torch the Cornhuskers so far has been No. 2-ranked Michigan Wolverines.
The Illini offense has been far from the Wolverines, only scoring 21.6 points and averaging over two turnovers per game. Still, the Illini average nearly 400 yards per game, showing their troubles don’t include moving the ball.
Punching the ball into the endzone has been difficult for the program lately, and it ends up getting the defense in trouble. Led by junior lineman Jer’Zhan Newton, the defense has performed well this year, despite what the final scores may seem. Head coach Bret Bielema has noted that the offense hasn’t made it easy for them.
“We really put out defense in a position to, not have great success,” Bielema said. “You couldn’t win that game if we didn’t go for it, even though it put our defense, really defensively, I feel we put them in 20-21 points, however you want to look at it. We put them in short field when we went for it on fourth down and again with the onside kick.”
An interesting note for this game is the state of Memorial Stadium. A Tuesday night fire under the horseshoe saw firetrucks and police cars lined down East Kirby Avenue and the north side of the stadium as students and locals gathered around the smoky stadium.
“The fire was quickly contained and has been extinguished,” read an Illinois Athletics press release late Tuesday night. “DIA (Division of Intercollegiate Athletics) will continue to evaluate the facility over the course of the next day but early indications are positive that the stadium will be prepared to host the game, as scheduled and without interruption of seating or services, for the game on Friday.”
The show must go on. Friday marks the Illini’s third night game of the year and second Friday game. The Illini are currently on a three-game win streak in the series, and one more will tie the longest win streak in their matchup history. A win will also bring the Illini back to a .500 record, which they will strive to hover around or above for the remainder of the season to make a bowl game.

--- Content from https://dailyillini.com/sports-stories/mens-sports/football/2023/10/03/column-what-ever-happened-to-consistency/ ---

After falling to the Purdue Boilermakers on the road this past weekend, serious questions surround the Illinois football program. Inconsistent offensive play, penalties and a lack of swagger leave the Illini at an underwhelming 2-3 through five weeks, but is there reason to believe they’ll turn it around?
You could say the 2023 squad has hit its floor and can only go up, but the latter isnʼt true. They could very easily stay the same, which they have done for the last four games. The biggest and most crucial thing needing to be fixed is the offense, and itʼs not just any one player.
“It takes all 11, that’s the thing,” said junior wide receiver Isaiah Williams. “At times, youʼve got everybody thatʼs doing great things. Sometimes, one group might do it (make a good play), or another group might do it, but we need all 11 to do it at one time.”
Offensive identity. No position group has separated themselves to lead the offense, nor do any look close. Sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer gets flustered under pressure, the wide receivers drop too many passes, the o-line is miserable, and junior running back Reggie Love III is on the sideline in street clothes and a boot.
The Illini of 2022 were a pound-the-ground, physical rushing offense that didnʼt turn the ball over through the air. They were good at it, it worked and they stayed true to it every game. Now, even when something works, you never see it again due to play call changing or an inability to repeat it on the field, which cannot continue.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

“I think we gotta have some hard conversations,” said head coach Bret Bielema. “I try to put it in their hands, but as a head coach, Iʼve got to decide what our identity is and force it that way.”
Consistency may sound complicated for a struggling team, but the Illiniʼs first steps are actually quite simple. In fact, itʼs as simple as throwing and catching the football. In Illinoisʼ two biggest matchups against Penn State and Purdue, the Illini have missed five wide-open touchdown opportunities.
“You canʼt have success,” a stressed Bielema said after Purdue. “I mean, we had two guys wide open. I mean, those are touchdown plays. Those are big opportunities, right? We gotta be able to connect on those things, and we gotta be able to execute.”
Now, you may ask, what do you mean by “wide open?” Go back and watch the highlights. Because what I mean is receivers with at least 10-15 yards of separation streaking toward the end zone when the pass was either off-target or dropped. Thatʼs 35 missed points across two games on just five plays. If you hit on these “easy” plays, the games are closer, changing the game plan and confidence of the Illini, potentially leading to another win or two.
“Bottom line is you gotta make plays in this league,” Bielema said. “As coaches, we gotta do so much better. Personally, as a head coach, being in a 16-13 halftime game and have it end that way … thatʼs obviously embarrassing.”
Another way to develop consistency is to cut down on penalties. Thereʼs no great time to commit a penalty, but it always seems to come at the worst times for the Illini. A good gain on first down reverts right back to second and long after a false start or hold. A third and long stop is negated by a pass interference or roughing the passer. Whenever the Illini seemingly start doing something well, fans can reasonably assume a penalty is coming.
How bad has it been? The Illini are currently ranked 110 out of 133 FBS schools in penalties, averaging 7.4 per game. Itʼs also worth noting that those are only enforced penalties, and the Illini have committed more. Unlike offensive consistency, where everyone is accountable, this lack of discipline falls directly on the coaching staff.
The current starters are not only unprepared for big moments but unprepared to be on the field. Every coach, from Bielema to the coordinators, to the analysts, should be putting in overtime to make sure these mistakes decrease. It costs them too much to have these unforced errors continue, and the results will only change once their actions do.
While the results arenʼt there, neither is that fun team from a year ago. In order to be a good team, you have to act like one. The days of Chase Brown hitting the Heisman in the endzone and Devon Witherspoon strutting all over the field, chirping at anyone with ears, are over.
The emotions on this team are subdued, and the confidence levels are low all around. Itʼs time to let some rage out and get back to physical and fiery football. The fans want to see the swagger, and a more amped-up group should be able to make some more winning plays.
So, are the Illini capable of fixing these mistakes? Probably. But they better do it soon because we are approaching the midseason point, and they are in serious jeopardy of missing a bowl game for the second time in three years under Bielema.

After falling to the Purdue Boilermakers on the road this past weekend, serious questions surround the Illinois football program. Inconsistent offensive play, penalties and a lack of swagger leave the Illini at an underwhelming 2-3 through five weeks, but is there reason to believe they’ll turn it around?
You could say the 2023 squad has hit its floor and can only go up, but the latter isnʼt true. They could very easily stay the same, which they have done for the last four games. The biggest and most crucial thing needing to be fixed is the offense, and itʼs not just any one player.
“It takes all 11, that’s the thing,” said junior wide receiver Isaiah Williams. “At times, youʼve got everybody thatʼs doing great things. Sometimes, one group might do it (make a good play), or another group might do it, but we need all 11 to do it at one time.”
Offensive identity. No position group has separated themselves to lead the offense, nor do any look close. Sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer gets flustered under pressure, the wide receivers drop too many passes, the o-line is miserable, and junior running back Reggie Love III is on the sideline in street clothes and a boot.
The Illini of 2022 were a pound-the-ground, physical rushing offense that didnʼt turn the ball over through the air. They were good at it, it worked and they stayed true to it every game. Now, even when something works, you never see it again due to play call changing or an inability to repeat it on the field, which cannot continue.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

“I think we gotta have some hard conversations,” said head coach Bret Bielema. “I try to put it in their hands, but as a head coach, Iʼve got to decide what our identity is and force it that way.”
Consistency may sound complicated for a struggling team, but the Illiniʼs first steps are actually quite simple. In fact, itʼs as simple as throwing and catching the football. In Illinoisʼ two biggest matchups against Penn State and Purdue, the Illini have missed five wide-open touchdown opportunities.
“You canʼt have success,” a stressed Bielema said after Purdue. “I mean, we had two guys wide open. I mean, those are touchdown plays. Those are big opportunities, right? We gotta be able to connect on those things, and we gotta be able to execute.”
Now, you may ask, what do you mean by “wide open?” Go back and watch the highlights. Because what I mean is receivers with at least 10-15 yards of separation streaking toward the end zone when the pass was either off-target or dropped. Thatʼs 35 missed points across two games on just five plays. If you hit on these “easy” plays, the games are closer, changing the game plan and confidence of the Illini, potentially leading to another win or two.
“Bottom line is you gotta make plays in this league,” Bielema said. “As coaches, we gotta do so much better. Personally, as a head coach, being in a 16-13 halftime game and have it end that way … thatʼs obviously embarrassing.”
Another way to develop consistency is to cut down on penalties. Thereʼs no great time to commit a penalty, but it always seems to come at the worst times for the Illini. A good gain on first down reverts right back to second and long after a false start or hold. A third and long stop is negated by a pass interference or roughing the passer. Whenever the Illini seemingly start doing something well, fans can reasonably assume a penalty is coming.
How bad has it been? The Illini are currently ranked 110 out of 133 FBS schools in penalties, averaging 7.4 per game. Itʼs also worth noting that those are only enforced penalties, and the Illini have committed more. Unlike offensive consistency, where everyone is accountable, this lack of discipline falls directly on the coaching staff.
The current starters are not only unprepared for big moments but unprepared to be on the field. Every coach, from Bielema to the coordinators, to the analysts, should be putting in overtime to make sure these mistakes decrease. It costs them too much to have these unforced errors continue, and the results will only change once their actions do.

As the Illini (2-3, 0-2) entered Ross-Ade Stadium in West Lafayette, Indiana, they entered more than just a rivalry game. Sure, these teams are close and have endured some fierce matchups over the years, but this one just meant more. A statement was made on Saturday afternoon, with the Illini getting trounced in a 44-19 loss.
The Purdue Boilermakers (2-3, 1-1) are manned by former Illini defensive coordinator Ryan Walters, who left for the Gold and Black this offseason. Not only did Walters leave for a Big Ten West rival, but he also had some messages for Illinois via Twitter following his departure.
One of the first decisions Walters made at his new school? Securing his new quarterback. The Illini had two major quarterback transfers visit this offseason, sophomores Hudson Card and Luke Altmyer. Card, the higher rated of the two, left Champaign without committing and joined Walters in West Lafayette.
His first decision against his former team? Allowing their offense on the field first, as they have started every game thus far. Altmyer rushed for 39 yards on the first play, the only smooth play of the drive. A fourth down conversion pushed the Illini into the red zone, but Altmyer missed a wide-open redshirt freshman tight end Henry Boyer for a touchdown forcing them to settle for a field goal.
Defensively, the Illini showed Walters what he was missing on their opening drive, only rushing three but still getting some pressure with junior defensive tackle Jer’Zhan Newton. A punt pushed the Illini back inside the ten, where their mistakes continued.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

”We need all 11 guys,” said junior receiver Isaiah Williams. “That’s the biggest thing right now, everyone getting on the same page and being able to consistently do your job.”
Altmyer dropped back to pass and missed an open Casey Washington on the right side. He also missed a blitzing defensive back who blasted Altmyer’s blindside resulting in a fumble. Purdue fell on the ball in the endzone for the game’s opening touchdown and a 6-3 lead.
“We aren’t protecting our quarterback,” said head coach Bret Bielema. “Luke is gonna take some heat, and in the second half, once they saw the issues we were having in protection, they just kept bringing it.”
The Illini offense did little on their next two drives, and the defense began to fatigue early in the second quarter. Just as the Boilermakers started picking up some rhythm on the ground, the Illini defense stood tall. Sophomore linebacker Dylan Rosiek punched the ball out of the running back’s grasp for a turnover.
Altmyer led the offense onto the field with renewed confidence, ready to reward the defense for their huge stop. After sophomore Josh McCray rushed for a quick seven-yard gain, Altmyer picked up a first down with a 17-yard completion to junior receiver Pat Bryant. Williams was the next target, hauling in a pass and running inside the red zone for a 49-yard gain. McCray took it from there with another seven-yard run into the endzone to regain the lead.
The lead didn’t last long, as Purdue responded with their own lengthy drive. A pass interference call — that Bielema strongly disapproved of — and a 30-yard completion converted back-to-back third downs for the Boilermakers as they got past midfield. Their first offensive touchdown put them up 13-10 before late field goals for both teams kept the lead at three heading to the locker room.
Purdue shot out of a cannon in the second half, marching 75 yards for a touchdown to extend its lead to 10. The Illini could not respond as Bryant dropped a potential 63-yard touchdown pass, and the game began to get out of hand. While the Illini shot themselves in the foot a bunch, it was clear Walter’s had his defense ready.
“I knew, going against Coach Walt every day, he knows (Illinois’) offense,” Williams said. “There were several times out there on the field where those guys knew exactly what we were going to do.”
Missed opportunities and sloppy penalties again plagued the Illini, two characteristics that have been evident in each game this season.
“Well, obviously very disappointed,” Bielema said after the game. “The tail end of the game was probably third downs. We were abysmal on offense, and they were pretty good on defense.”
The Illini have shown they are more than capable of winning these games, but they learned the hard way that unforced errors do not result in joyful endings. Card and Walters get the first laugh, but it certainly won’t be the last.

Illinois football’s (2-2, 0-1) season has not been pretty so far, but it still holds the keys to its season, which is far from over. The Illini’s first road game of the Big Ten season is against a familiar face, as its former defensive coordinator Ryan Walters leads the Purdue Boilermakers (1-3, 0-1) in a battle of divisional rivals.
The last matchup between the two programs came last November, part of a massive skid that derailed Illinois’ hopes for a Big Ten West crown. The Boilermakers stormed into Champaign and took a 31-24 win back to West Lafayette en route to the Big Ten championship game.
For the Illini, a tight win over the Florida Atlantic Owls finished off their non-conference schedule. Head coach Bret Bielema gave his thoughts in the post-game press conference about heading into the grind of Big Ten football season.
“Obviously, I’d love to be 4-0 going into conference play,” Bielema said. “But to be 2-2 with the amount of players we’ve played and the amount of adversity we’ve had at certain positions, it’s pretty good.”
Much has changed this season for both the Illini and Boilermakers, with new starting quarterbacks and coaching staff changes. However, both programs will surely say that they are disappointed by the start to the season. Purdue is winless at home, and while Illinois has only played on the road once so far, it was an ugly loss to Kansas.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

With sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer under center, the Illini are looking to play with more speed, which the Ole Miss transfer emphasized in his post-game media availability on Saturday.
“The emphasis of the week was to play with a lot of pace and physicality,” Altmyer said. “We find a lot of success when we do that. I am looking forward to keeping that going.”
Junior wide receiver Isaiah Williams spoke about what he felt needed to change going into another year of Big Ten play with the emphasis being faster starts.
“We have to start fast,” Williams said. “We have to be able to move the ball down the field, make plays and just build that momentum early. We can’t just wait for the second quarter or the second half to get that momentum going.”
The slow starts have plagued the Illini as they have scored in the first quarter just once all season with multiple opportunities to do so being cut short by turnovers and missed field goals. The Illini have been outscored by 31 points in the first half through four games.
Things are similar for the Boilermakers who have been outscored by 28 in the first half in their first four games. Their struggles are a product of the defense giving up about 19 points per first half. Regardless of the different records, the similarities are certainly there.
As far as the history goes, the teams are around even with Purdue leading the all-time series 47-45-6. Even the home and away stats are close, as Illinois is 23-23-4 on the road and 22-24-2 at home against the neighboring state rivals.
The Illini travel to West Lafayette for a 2:30 p.m. start time on Saturday, and for the first time all season they will be exclusively available on the Peacock streaming service.

Illinois (2-2, 0-1) entered week four of the 2023 season with a revitalized defense but questionable offense after a putrid loss to No. 7 Penn State a week prior. The bright side? The Illini schedule from this week on is the second easiest in the Big Ten, while their first three were the third-hardest across the FBS.
The visiting Florida Atlantic Owls (1-3) entered with the same record but with a huge piece missing on offense. The regular starting quarterback Casey Thompson tore his ACL a week prior as Clemson blew out FAU. The teams battled through a close contest, with the Illini taking the victory by a 23-17 score.
For the fourth game in a row, sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer and the Illini offense started with the ball. Altmyer looked precise on his first drive as junior wide receiver Isaiah Williams racked up 32 yards; however, the drive was stopped as junior running back Reggie Love failed to convert on fourth down.
The Illini defense stepped up on their first drive, forcing a fumble that was recovered by the Owls but ultimately making the visitors punt. On the ensuing drive, Altmyer was strip-sacked and the Owls took over in prime field position. The Owls took advantage by getting a field goal on the board, but the Illini defense stood strong in the red zone.
Altmyer’s performance was a big focus for head coach Bret Bielema and the coaching staff after a difficult outing versus Penn State, but Altmyer spoke about his teammates being supportive of him in a time of adversity.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

“The teammates on this roster are just so encouraging, there are so many special people on the team who never lose sight of our goals,” Altmyer said. “It’s easy to dwindle down and get down on yourself after that, but we never hit the panic button on that or lost sight of what we had prepared to do this week.”
The offense did not do themselves any favors following the score, as they went three and out, with Altmyer being rocked on a third down sack for a loss of seven. The ensuing punt return had an extra 15 yards tacked on via an unnecessary roughness penalty on Illinois. The great field position helped the Owls take a 10-0 lead heading into the second quarter.
Illinois needed a score in the worst way possible, and a flea-flicker reverse got it done. Altmyer launched the ball deep to junior tight end Griffin Moore for a 46-yard touchdown, making it a 10-7 game. A plethora of defensive stops by both teams defined the majority of the second quarter.
However, Altmyer threw a dart downfield to junior tight end Tip Reiman for a 42-yard gain. Altmyer followed up with a seven-yard rushing touchdown to put Illinois up 14-10 near the end of the first half. The Illini attempted to get something before the half ended but failed to do so as they took a 14-10 lead into the locker room.
The Illini defense started the second half with a stop, led by a sack from junior defensive tackle Keith Randolph Jr., forcing a punt from the Owls. Altmyer and the Illini offense advanced deep down the field via a “moss” catch by Williams, followed by a 15-yard penalty to get into the red zone. Redshirt freshman running back Aidan Laughery took it in for a touchdown, making it a 20-10 Illinois lead after the extra point attempt doinked off the right post.
After the game, Randolph gave his fellow linemen high praise, putting them amongst the nation’s most elite front seven groups.
“I feel like we’re one of the best in the country when everybody is playing at their best,” Randolph said. “Now, it’s about being consistent and doing it every play and game.”
The Owls made their way downfield on their next drive, aided by a pair of bad penalties by the Illini defense. The defense held strong, forcing a field goal attempt that was missed wide right. Love took off for a 61-yard run following the missed field goal, setting the Illini deep in enemy territory. The Illini had a touchdown on the board before a holding call nullified it, which forced the Illini to kick a field goal, making it a 23-10 game.
The FAU defense forced a fumble deep in Illinois territory, starting from the 13-yard line in the red zone. Senior defensive back Nicario Harper made a great play on a ball in midair, coming down with an end-zone interception. After a couple of defensive stops, the Owls got back into the endzone, securing their first points since the first quarter to make it a 23-17 game.
Bielema praised the defense first and foremost at his postgame press conference.
“It’s exciting to come out with a win,” Bielema said. “I liked our perseverance, I think the story of the day was by far our defense.”
Freshman running back Kaden Feagin iced the game on a solid run up the middle, going down before the endzone to solidify an Illini win.
Bielema spoke highly of Feagin’s decision to slide down, saying it was the right move.
“We call that grind to get down,” Bielema said. “To have him have the awareness to get down and win the game was just awesome.”
The Illini travel to West Lafayette for their first road conference game of the year, facing off against a familiar opponent. Purdue (1-3, 0-1) head coach Ryan Walters will have his first chance to coach against his former team, who had arguably the best defense in the nation under his guidance a season ago.

Week four of the college football season is upon us as the Illini (1-2) prepare to face their final nonconference regular season opponent. The Florida Atlantic Owls (1-2) are visiting Champaign, Illinois, for a 2:30 p.m. CT game on Saturday.
Like the Illini, the Owls prepared a difficult slate to kick off 2023. After a 48-14-point defeat to the talented Clemson Tigers, FAU looks to get back to .500 on Saturday. The Illini have the same goal in mind, but both teams will be without key players when they take the field this weekend.
Senior quarterback Casey Thompson is the biggest name not available in this matchup. FAU will be without their quarterback for the remainder of the season after Thompson tore his meniscus and ACL against the Tigers. The veteran played for the Texas Longhorns and Nebraska Cornhuskers before transferring to the Owls for his final season of eligibility.
Thompson’s replacement, junior Daniel Richardson, also transferred this offseason from Central Michigan. Richardson struggled against the Tigers, but recent Illini injury news may benefit the new Owl quarterback. Sophomore safety Demetrius Hill and defensive back Matthew Bailey were both announced out for the season with a torn ACL and shoulder tissue damage, respectively.
The losses are both significant for the Illini, who had a deep secondary. Both safeties had starting experience from their freshman seasons and would have been relied upon to show leadership in a relatively new defensive back unit. The Illini are still solid at the position, but their depth has now been salted away, and more injuries will threaten the consistency of the defense.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

While the secondary was hurt, the front seven had a clean injury report following their best performance yet. A slow start in week one proved to be an anomaly for a group that has been one of the best in the conference and country since 2022. Junior defensive lineman Jer’Zhan Newton continues to make Power Five offensive lines look like mid-majors and is playing the best football of his career.
Newton and the rest of the stout Illini front seven played well enough to beat the No. 7 team in the country on Saturday, but their quarterback did not. Sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer had his worst collegiate showing in his biggest game yet throwing for just 163 yards and four interceptions. However, the Illini remain confident in Altmyer, and the former Ole Miss Rebel will continue to start under center.
Altmyer may have had a rough day, but the rest of the offense was solid. Offensive coordinator Barry Lunney Jr. called a diverse game plan, mixing runs and passes to get the ball into playmakers’ hands. Thirteen different Illini caught passes on Saturday, including junior receiver Isaiah Williams leading the way with five catches for 63 yards. Freshman receiver Malik Elzy notably got in on the action with three catches for 28 yards and a touchdown grab.
The receivers will be a big part of the game plan once again as the Illini look to get another win and, most importantly, give Altmyer confidence heading into the conference schedule. Defensively, the Illini should have little trouble shutting down the Owls in the latter of their only consecutive home game stretch of the year.

Sports are among the world’s most lucrative forms of entertainment, so when issues within are brought to light, they stand out all the more. Since the inception of sports, owners, coaches and athletes have been put on pedestals and worshiped by society, but they are no strangers to scandals and illegal activity. 
We need joy in life — something to pour passion and loyalty into that consumes our time and gives us a break from the serious things in life. However, these sports figures we idolize are not immune to struggle and bad choices, especially not to the consequences that follow.
The Big Ten is finishing the process of losing its second head football coach in three months. Two disastrous cases remind us that getting millions of dollars yearly and being shown on TV every Saturday does not mean you are a good person. 
It began when the Daily Northwestern — Northwestern University’s student newspaper — released an article detailing claims of vicious hazing in the football program. The school suspended then-head coach Pat Fitzgerald for two weeks as they discussed the program’s future. 
As more details emerged of the hazing that included “forced participation, nudity and sexualized acts of degrading nature,” as Northwestern President Michael Schill described, the school could not keep Fitzgerald around any longer. His contract was terminated on July 10, but that could not save the program from its broken state. 


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Three of the program’s most talented players transferred to different schools in the following weeks, and alumni of the program and school criticized the behavior that got so out of hand. The actions under Fitzgerald’s watch will forever scar everyone affected. In the most recent case, players for the Michigan State Spartans aren’t directly affected by the actions of former head coach Mel Tucker, but a man they looked up to failed them all the same. 
Tucker continues to deny allegations that he sexually harassed rape survivor Brenda Tracy, claiming that “other motives are at play” for the university. Whether his claims are valid or dying words from a man in trouble, Tucker put himself in a horrible situation, giving Michigan State cause to fire the coach for his actions.
While monitoring these cases at other schools, it is essential to remember what coaches’ jobs really are on college campuses. The Illinois athletic department made their code of conduct available after the recent affairs, outlining what their employees adhere to in their work environment. Above all else, the code of conduct states that employees “serve as role models and mentors for all DIA (Division of Intercollegiate Athletics) student-athletes.”
These people are supposed to be leaders. They recruit people’s children to come to a university and learn how to become the best athlete and person they can be and “promote the safety and well-being of student-athletes.” It is immediately apparent that Fitzgerald and Tucker violated the most important aspects of their role with the team during their tenure by either physically and/or emotionally harming the men on the field or setting poor life examples.  
The Illini have experience comparing their employees’ behaviors with the code of conduct in recent years, the most notable being men’s head basketball coach Brad Underwood in 2018. At the time of the probe, Underwood was entering his third season as a coach in Champaign when the University received tips concerning enough information to lead to a full investigation within the basketball program.
The News-Gazette was the first to report this breaking news, citing the DIA report that Underwood had been accused of “verbal abuse, racial harassment and punitive use of physical activity.” After a month, the University’s legal counsel and faculty investigation representatives concluded that the accusations were false. 
Underwood has always shown his fiery personality on the floor, occasionally getting into players’ faces without regard for their eardrums. However, as long as the words he bellows match the guidelines listed in the DIA policies, the committee found that Underwood was within his rights.
The University was also contacted in 2015 regarding the football and women’s basketball teams. Neither issue received an investigation. Three instances over a decade show that the Illini are more than willing to put student-athletes’ well-being first. But, after all three turned into nothing, it also shows the Illini hired coaches who care for the players and follow the guidelines.
At the end of the day, collegiate athletics go far beyond just winning and losing, and programs like Northwestern and Michigan State football have lost sight of that. For now, the Illini have not been impacted and continue on the right trend for the future. Still, the last three months pose a warning to the rest of the country: Remember your duty to these kids.

Three of the program’s most talented players transferred to different schools in the following weeks, and alumni of the program and school criticized the behavior that got so out of hand. The actions under Fitzgerald’s watch will forever scar everyone affected. In the most recent case, players for the Michigan State Spartans aren’t directly affected by the actions of former head coach Mel Tucker, but a man they looked up to failed them all the same. 
Tucker continues to deny allegations that he sexually harassed rape survivor Brenda Tracy, claiming that “other motives are at play” for the university. Whether his claims are valid or dying words from a man in trouble, Tucker put himself in a horrible situation, giving Michigan State cause to fire the coach for his actions.
While monitoring these cases at other schools, it is essential to remember what coaches’ jobs really are on college campuses. The Illinois athletic department made their code of conduct available after the recent affairs, outlining what their employees adhere to in their work environment. Above all else, the code of conduct states that employees “serve as role models and mentors for all DIA (Division of Intercollegiate Athletics) student-athletes.”
These people are supposed to be leaders. They recruit people’s children to come to a university and learn how to become the best athlete and person they can be and “promote the safety and well-being of student-athletes.” It is immediately apparent that Fitzgerald and Tucker violated the most important aspects of their role with the team during their tenure by either physically and/or emotionally harming the men on the field or setting poor life examples.  
The Illini have experience comparing their employees’ behaviors with the code of conduct in recent years, the most notable being men’s head basketball coach Brad Underwood in 2018. At the time of the probe, Underwood was entering his third season as a coach in Champaign when the University received tips concerning enough information to lead to a full investigation within the basketball program.
The News-Gazette was the first to report this breaking news, citing the DIA report that Underwood had been accused of “verbal abuse, racial harassment and punitive use of physical activity.” After a month, the University’s legal counsel and faculty investigation representatives concluded that the accusations were false. 
Underwood has always shown his fiery personality on the floor, occasionally getting into players’ faces without regard for their eardrums. However, as long as the words he bellows match the guidelines listed in the DIA policies, the committee found that Underwood was within his rights.
The University was also contacted in 2015 regarding the football and women’s basketball teams. Neither issue received an investigation. Three instances over a decade show that the Illini are more than willing to put student-athletes’ well-being first. But, after all three turned into nothing, it also shows the Illini hired coaches who care for the players and follow the guidelines.
At the end of the day, collegiate athletics go far beyond just winning and losing, and programs like Northwestern and Michigan State football have lost sight of that. For now, the Illini have not been impacted and continue on the right trend for the future. Still, the last three months pose a warning to the rest of the country: Remember your duty to these kids.

Illini helmet lays on the turf during game against Penn State on Saturday.
Sports columnist Ben Fader writes on the sexual misconduct within football.
Sports are among the world’s most lucrative forms of entertainment, so when issues within are brought to light, they stand out all the more. Since the inception of sports, owners, coaches and athletes have been put on pedestals and worshiped by society, but they are no strangers to scandals and illegal activity. 
We need joy in life — something to pour passion and loyalty into that consumes our time and gives us a break from the serious things in life. However, these sports figures we idolize are not immune to struggle and bad choices, especially not to the consequences that follow.
The Big Ten is finishing the process of losing its second head football coach in three months. Two disastrous cases remind us that getting millions of dollars yearly and being shown on TV every Saturday does not mean you are a good person. 
It began when the Daily Northwestern — Northwestern University’s student newspaper — released an article detailing claims of vicious hazing in the football program. The school suspended then-head coach Pat Fitzgerald for two weeks as they discussed the program’s future. 
As more details emerged of the hazing that included “forced participation, nudity and sexualized acts of degrading nature,” as Northwestern President Michael Schill described, the school could not keep Fitzgerald around any longer. His contract was terminated on July 10, but that could not save the program from its broken state. 
Three of the program’s most talented players transferred to different schools in the following weeks, and alumni of the program and school criticized the behavior that got so out of hand. The actions under Fitzgerald’s watch will forever scar everyone affected.

The Illini (1-2, 0-1) hosted the Penn State Nittany Lions (3-0, 1-0) in the first meeting between the programs since an iconic and historical 2021 meeting where the Illini pulled off a 20-18 upset in 9OT. That was Illini head coach Bret Bielema’s first major win with the program in year one.
The Illini are in a much different position than two years ago, while the Nittany Lions are in an even better position. The Illini came into the game as heavy underdogs after two lackluster performances to open the year, while the Nittany Lions entered with a superstar freshman at quarterback, Drew Allar, who has led the program to dominant wins to start their season. For both teams, it was the first Big Ten game of the season. Both teams were keen on a 1-0 start in conference play, and it was the Nittany Lions who did just that with a punishing 30-13 win.
Illinois had the first possession of the game, and the offense looked alive and well under the guidance of sophomore quarterback Luke Altmyer and junior running back Reggie Love III. However, the drive ended with nothing, as senior kicker Caleb Griffin missed a 47-yard field goal to the left.
Allar and the Nittany Lions offense were stifled on their first drive by a rejuvenated Illini defense, forcing a punt. The ensuing drive for Illinois was cut short on a fumble by sophomore running back Josh McCray. Penn State took over on the host’s side of the field, but Illinois held strong, forcing a field goal, giving the visitors a 3-0 lead.
The following Illini drive ended early again, this time via an Altmyer interception. Illinois’ defense continued to look alive throughout the first quarter with four tackles for loss, forcing another Penn State field goal to make it 6-0. Another interception by Altmyer marked the third Illinois turnover of the first quarter.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Penn State scored the first touchdown of the day to take a 13-0 lead early in the second quarter. Illinois’ offense continued to sputter after missing the field goal on its opening drive, punting from their own 18-yard line. Penn State’s field goal was blocked on the next drive by junior defensive lineman Jer’Zhan Newton, which held the score at 13-0.
Senior wide receiver Casey Washington made a couple of defenders miss as the Illini inched closer to the endzone following the blocked field goal, and Love forced his way into the end zone. The touchdown gave the Illini life, as they made it a 13-7 game with just over two minutes left in the half.
The Illini defense showed some warning signs from last week, where they collapsed in the final seconds of the first half. Penn State drove all the way to the red zone in just 30 seconds, scoring a field goal to head into the locker rooms with a 16-7 lead.
The Illini defense started the second half by forcing a three-and-out on the Nittany Lions, putting the offense in good field position early in the half. Altmyer threw an absolute dime to junior wide receiver Isaiah Williams, which was caught at the Penn State 25-yard line, before following up with his third interception of the game, which was also the fourth turnover of the game.
The defense held strong once again, as defensive coordinator Aaron Henry’s guys responded well to the criticism over the past two weeks. The Illini offense came back on the field and picked up a couple of first downs. However, a penalty and controversial spot forced another punt.
Altmyer’s struggles continued as he nearly threw his fourth interception of the game, but it was through the hands of a Penn State defender, and Illinois punted once again. The Nittany Lions used some trickery for a half-back option that resulted in a touchdown, making it a 23-7 game.
Altmyer threw his fourth interception of the game at the end of the third quarter directly to the defender as well. The Illini defense kept them in it all game long, but time after time, the offense lacked the ability to capitalize on momentum. Penn State opened the fourth quarter with a touchdown run to go up 30-7.
Bielema chose to sit Altmyer for the rest of the game, bringing senior quarterback John Paddock in for clean-up duties. As the stadium emptied, the game wound into a blowout.
The Illini defense showed up despite the final score. The offense, however, has countless questions to answer over the week leading up to Saturday’s game against Florida Atlantic.

Head Coach Bret Bielma takes action on the field during the fourth quarter of today’s game against Penn State. 
The Illini (1-2, 0-1) hosted the Penn State Nittany Lions (3-0, 1-0) in the first meeting between the programs since an iconic and historical 2021 meeting where the Illini pulled off a 20-18 upset in 9OT. That was Illini head coach Bret Bielema’s first major win with the program in year one.

The first two weeks of the 2023 season have not gone according to plan for the Illini (1-1), and it doesn’t get any easier in week three. The No. 7 Penn State Nittany Lions (2-0) travel to Champaign for an 11 a.m. CT matchup on FOX.
Negativity has surrounded the Illini after they were defeated by the Kansas Jayhawks last Friday night. However, Illini coaches quickly deflected any gloom directed towards them, preaching that they had been here before.
“I think the biggest thing that we took is, a year ago at this time, it was the exact same scenario,” said head coach Bret Bielema. “We were a 1-1 football team after a disappointing Friday night road game loss.”
Looking to get back on track, this will be the first time the two programs have met in Champaign since 2018. The Nittany Lions also seek revenge after falling at home in their most recent meeting in 2021 in nine overtimes.
Led by five-star freshman quarterback Drew Allar, the Nittany Lions high-octane offense will test the Illini in all facets. However, the Illini are the healthiest they have been all season with sophomore safety Matthew Bailey returning Saturday. With a full roster, it will be all hands-on deck against a program that hasn’t been in a competitive game yet.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Allar has been impressive in his first two collegiate games, racking up 529 yards on a whopping 78% completion percentage. He has five total touchdowns through two games and has only been sacked once, behind one of the nation’s top offensive lines.
Their dominance may prove difficult for an Illini defensive line that has not lived up to preseason hype thus far. While junior defensive lineman Jer’Zhan Newton had an impressive game against the Jayhawks with two sacks, the rest of the line was dominated Friday and against Toledo. The Illini would love a breakout game on Saturday, but it will be a challenge.
The Nittany Lion defense is equally talented as their offense, many returning from last year’s group that ended the 2022 campaign, shutting down Utah in a primetime Rose Bowl game. A linebacker duo of junior Curtis Jacobs and sophomore Abdul Carter lead the way for Penn State and are key players to watch on Saturday.
The overall athleticism from the Nittany Lions will provide exciting matchups for Illini receivers, who want to step up after last week and lead the Illini to victory.
“The dreams and aspirations in our room haven’t changed because of the results of one game,” Bielema said. “We have a 1-0 mentality. One of the goals we talked about was going 1-0 on a weekly basis.”
A win this week would put the Illini in a prime position to achieve their goals heading into their final nonconference game. It would also give the Illini their first consecutive game win streak against the Nittany Lions ever and first ranked win since November 2021.

Following a three-week break after finishing 10th at the Fighting Illini Invitational, Illinois men’s golf will travel to West Lafayette, Indiana, to face off against the field at the Purdue Fall Invitational on Monday and wrap up play on Tuesday.
Everything is in place for 54 holes of golf to unfold, with 36 holes being played on Monday and the remaining 18 on Tuesday at the Boilermakers’ Ackerman-Allen Course. This course is set to be a challenge as it is a parkland-style Pete Dye design featuring large bent-grass greens, fairways and tees. The course is set up to play as a par-72 at 7,245 yards.
Illinois comes into the tournament as the front-runner, ranking ninth in the nation by Golfweek, and goes up against six other top-100-ranked teams: Purdue (40), UNLV (54), VCU (79), Illinois State (84), Ball State (85) and Nebraska (87). The rest of the field includes Butler, Central Arkansas, Dayton, DePaul, Eastern Michigan, Miami, Northern Illinois and Western Kentucky.
The Illinois lineup for the tournament will consist of freshmen Ethan Wilson and Max Herendeen, fifth years Timmy Crawford and Tyler Goecke and junior Jackson Buchanan. The three individual competitors include sophomore Ryan Voois, fifth year Jerry Ji and senior Piercen Hunt.
Following a disappointing finish in the Fighting Illini Invitational, Illini fans are desperate for a top finish in Illinois’ first Purdue Fall Invitational. Illinois seems to understand this, as they are heading to West Lafayette with their four highest-ranked golfers in the PGA Tour university rankings, with Goecke ranking No. 75 nationally, Hunt at No.79, Crawford at No. 149 and Ji at No. 172.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Herendeen shined in September with back-to-back top 15 finishes in the Sahalee Players Championship and Fighting Illini Invitational. Herendeen finished second in the Sahalee Players Championship, displaying grit, composure and excellence in Washington, where he turned in a near-flawless five-under-par performance.
If the Illini are able to get this excellence from Herendeen, they should be set up to succeed, as the team won the Sahalee Players Championship, with Herendeen’s masterful performance playing a big role in their top finish.
The Illini look to bounce back from the rough finish in the Fighting Illini Invitational with a top five finish to prove why they are a top 10 team in the country. The Illini look to show flashes of the team that won the Sahalee Players Championship just a month ago with stout-level play from Herendeen and the rest of the team.
In the team’s third to last tournament of the calendar year, Illinois men’s golf will look to end the year strong by going low and avoiding hazards in West Lafayette.

Following a three-week break after finishing 10th at the Fighting Illini Invitational, Illinois men’s golf will travel to West Lafayette, Indiana, to face off against the field at the Purdue Fall Invitational on Monday and wrap up play on Tuesday.
Everything is in place for 54 holes of golf to unfold, with 36 holes being played on Monday and the remaining 18 on Tuesday at the Boilermakers’ Ackerman-Allen Course. This course is set to be a challenge as it is a parkland-style Pete Dye design featuring large bent-grass greens, fairways and tees. The course is set up to play as a par-72 at 7,245 yards.
Illinois comes into the tournament as the front-runner, ranking ninth in the nation by Golfweek, and goes up against six other top-100-ranked teams: Purdue (40), UNLV (54), VCU (79), Illinois State (84), Ball State (85) and Nebraska (87). The rest of the field includes Butler, Central Arkansas, Dayton, DePaul, Eastern Michigan, Miami, Northern Illinois and Western Kentucky.
The Illinois lineup for the tournament will consist of freshmen Ethan Wilson and Max Herendeen, fifth years Timmy Crawford and Tyler Goecke and junior Jackson Buchanan. The three individual competitors include sophomore Ryan Voois, fifth year Jerry Ji and senior Piercen Hunt.

Mike Small enters his 24th season leading the Illini menʼs golf program as its head coach, and his historic success was rewarded by the Board of Trustees at a Friday meeting which saw a couple of other points on the agenda.
This meeting was also historic, as it was the first time in about a decade that the sitting governor attended in person, as Gov. JB Pritzker watched the Board approve a six-year extension for Small, which will pay him $400,000 per year with built-in raises.
Under Small, the Illini menʼs golf program has risen to incredible heights, with 13 of the last 14 Big Ten titles residing in Champaign. Small has also seen the growth and development of a dozen Big Ten Player of the Year honorees, also mentoring a pair of individual national champions, Scott Langley in 2010 and Thomas Pieters in 2012.
The success has not only been in-conference, as the Illini have finished in the top five nationally in eight out of the last 12 postseasons, with 2013 being the runner-up. The Illini have gone past the NCAA regionals 16 times with Small at the helm.
Five regional titles, four of which were consecutive from 2013-16 have paved the road for Smallʼs continued presence in Champaign. Additionally, the Illinois program owns the longest streak for being ranked at the top of the Golfweek/Bushnell Coachesʼ Top 25 Poll. All of these achievements are certainly worthy of his Big Ten record 13 Coach of the Year awards, and induction into the Golf Coaches Association of America Hall of Fame.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Small’s extension keeps him in Champaign through 2028-29.

Following a weekend of competition and a week of full practice, Illinois men’s tennis is back on the road for the ITA All-American Championships. Eight of Illinois’ 11-man roster will be in action throughout the various stages of the pre-qualifying, qualifying and main draws.
Several Illini will enter the competition on a high note thanks to last weekend, with sophomore and Milwaukee Tennis Classic champion Kenta Miyoshi being the highest. Head coach Brad Dancer, who traveled to San Francisco with senior Alex Petrov and junior Karlis Ozolins last weekend, emphasized the point that no matter the circumstances or competition level, winning is a plus.
“It always helps to win matches,” Dancer said. “It never hurts to win matches, so I think any way you can get through helps pump the confidence a little bit.”
On Saturday, graduate student Oliver Okonkwo, redshirt senior Lucas Horve, junior William Mroz and freshman Jeremy Zhang will lead off in the pre-qualifying singles draw. Of the 256 participants in the pre-qualifying draw, the final 16 will advance to qualifying.
Provided some number of Illini advance through the four rounds necessary to claim such a spot, they will join Petrov and senior Hunter Heck on Monday in the 128-man qualifying race for 16 spots in the main draw.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Ozolins and Miyoshi begin in the main singles draw. Miyoshi holds a wild card position due to his performance in August’s ITA Summer Championship. The main draw features 64 competitors, with the eventual champion needing to advance through six straight matches.
It is no doubt a gauntlet, particularly for those hoping to make deep runs via the pre-qualifying and qualifying draws.
Meanwhile, three quarters of the group will also be occupied with the doubles draw. There is no pre-qualifying doubles draw, so Okonkwo/Horve and Miyoshi/Petrov will serve in the qualifying round on Monday. After three rounds of competition, eight main draw bids are granted to those still standing. 
Heck and Ozolins, 2023 NCAA All-Americans, earned a spot in the main draw thanks to a No. 23 ranking at the end of last season. They, plus whoever from Illinois makes it out of qualifying, will have four matches ahead of the championship round. 
The season is still young and Illinois has not had a lot of time to put a specific emphasis on technical needs tailored to the individuals, but as a whole there is no shortage of effort being poured into more encompassing goals. 
“One of the things we’re getting better with is our physical fitness,” Dancer said. “Our fitness is improving and we’re looking a lot at clarity of the plays that we’re running. So, when we’re playing doubles, what kind of balls we’re trying to draw. Singles, what type of plays we’re trying to run. A lot of defensive work as well, so that defensively we’re not tensing up but enjoying the moment of playing good defensive tennis and so forth.”

Last weekend featured Illinois men’s tennis’ first action of the fall season. It was a bit atypical, in that the squad split into two groups who traveled to destinations separated by a couple thousand miles. Head coach Brad Dancer, senior Alex Petrov and junior Karlis Ozolins went west to compete in the Battle In The Bay while assistant coach Tim Kopinski traveled to Milwaukee with redshirt senior Lucas Horve, sophomore Kenta Miyoshi, sophomore Tyler Bowers and freshman Jeremy Zhang.
Petrov and Ozolins took the court first, competing both as a duo and individually. By the end of the day, two of those three groups were still standing. In doubles, the two prevailed through a very tightly contested affair for an eventual 8-6 victory. Ozolins made short work of his opponent in the singles draw, advancing in straight sets with dominant 6-0 and 6-3 performances. Things appeared to be going well for Petrov, who came out on top of a tie-breaking 7-6 set but was ultimately bested through three sets.
The competition only got stiffer on day two, where the Illini fell out of the doubles draw in a nail-biting 8-7 loss. Ozolins continued to advance through the singles draw, winning 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 in the second round, but was defeated in the quarterfinals by a competitor from Michigan State.
Petrov went on to win a couple of consolation matches with ease. The first of which was a relatively uncontested straight-set outing (6-2, 6-3) whereas the second was complete dominance (6-1, 6-1). The growth shown by Petrov on the court was extremely encouraging for Dancer, who noted that this weekend seemed to reveal an entirely new layer of Petrov’s abilities. 
“For Petrov, it was great deliberation,” Dancer said. “We’re working on a lot of decompression, in terms of his arousal levels and so forth. He, almost going to the opposite end of that spectrum, went to being more emotional, letting more things emote. We got to see a more human side of him on the court, a playfulness. He’s always competed with a ferocity, which is fantastic, but there was certainly a playfulness that came about this weekend, and I think that’s a fantastic long-term path for him as he continues to try to grow.”


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Returning to the Midwest, Illinois’ superb collection of underclassmen was on full display. All four Illini participated in the singles draw, with Miyoshi/Horve and Zhang/Bowers being the doubles pairings. 
Bowers and Zhang cruised through their first singles matches. Both won in straight sets and lost just six games each. After dropping the first set 6-4, Miyoshi was fighting an uphill battle but unfortunately for his opponent, it was a battle that he came out on top of. He rallied to even the count with a 7-5 win in the second before putting the match away in the final stanza (6-3). 
Horve was the lone Illini who fell in the first round, but even he put up a valiant fight and had a dominant 6-2 second set victory. 
“It was a little heartbreaking for Lucas Horve,” Dancer said. “He’s been right on the cusp so many times and I think he had a great chance in one of his earlier matches to capitalize on that to take a seed’s position, but he didn’t do that and that’s kinda the way it goes.” 
Bowers was defeated in the second round, but both Miyoshi and Zhang advanced to the quarter finals. Miyoshi did so in straight sets while Zhang closed out a three-set match with an impressive 6-1 count. 
On the doubles side, Zhang/Bowers fell 6-3 in the first round while Miyoshi and Horve advanced as far as the second round.
Illinois’ numbers dwindled to one early in the second day, as Zhang was eliminated in the quarterfinals by No. 80 Toledo senior Pawit Sornlaksup. Miyoshi was matched up against Sornlaksup in the semifinal and was leading 6-1, 1-1 when Sornlaksup retired from the match, giving Miyoshi an early entry to the finals.
In the finals, Miyoshi dominated the first set. Of the six games he won en route to a 6-2 victory, he held his opponent to 15 or fewer four times. Although he ended up falling 7-5 in the second set, Miyoshi put up an extremely respectable effort and even had the game knotted at 40-40 during set-point. 
Entering the final set of the tournament, Miyoshi lost the first game on back-to-back double faults. Despite this being an extremely demoralizing position to be in, Miyoshi rebounded with some of his best tennis as an Illini that was capped off by an ace which brought the score to 4-1. From there, Miyoshi was in the driver’s seat and cruised to an eventual 6-3 victory which crowned him champion of the Milwaukee Tennis Classic.
“Kenta’s the story of Milwaukee,” Dancer said. “He’s living and breathing our program, he’s milking it for everything it’s worth, and that’s what we want out of our guys. It’s skill sessions and extra fitness and extra stretching and extra meditation, those things pay off. When you’re doing all those things and then you compete like an animal, which he does, you get a lot better.”

Sophomore Kenta Miyoshi serves against Michael Minasyan playing for Wisconsin in singles on Apr. 14.

Last weekend featured Illinois men’s tennis’ first action of the fall season. It was a bit atypical, in that the squad split into two groups who traveled to destinations separated by a couple thousand miles.

“For Petrov, it was great deliberation,” Dancer said. “We’re working on a lot of decompression, in terms of his arousal levels and so forth. He, almost going to the opposite end of that spectrum, went to being more emotional, letting more things emote. We got to see a more human side of him on the court, a playfulness. He’s always competed with a ferocity, which is fantastic, but there was certainly a playfulness that came about this weekend, and I think that’s a fantastic long-term path for him as he continues to try to grow.”
Returning to the Midwest, Illinois’ superb collection of underclassmen was on full display. All four Illini participated in the singles draw, with Miyoshi/Horve and Zhang/Bowers being the doubles pairings. 
Bowers and Zhang cruised through their first singles matches. Both won in straight sets and lost just six games each. After dropping the first set 6-4, Miyoshi was fighting an uphill battle but unfortunately for his opponent, it was a battle that he came out on top of. He rallied to even the count with a 7-5 win in the second before putting the match away in the final stanza (6-3). 
Horve was the lone Illini who fell in the first round, but even he put up a valiant fight and had a dominant 6-2 second set victory. 
“It was a little heartbreaking for Lucas Horve,” Dancer said. “He’s been right on the cusp so many times and I think he had a great chance in one of his earlier matches to capitalize on that to take a seed’s position, but he didn’t do that and that’s kinda the way it goes.” 
Bowers was defeated in the second round, but both Miyoshi and Zhang advanced to the quarter finals. Miyoshi did so in straight sets while Zhang closed out a three-set match with an impressive 6-1 count. 
On the doubles side, Zhang/Bowers fell 6-3 in the first round while Miyoshi and Horve advanced as far as the second round.
Illinois’ numbers dwindled to one early in the second day, as Zhang was eliminated in the quarterfinals by No. 80 Toledo senior Pawit Sornlaksup. Miyoshi was matched up against Sornlaksup in the semifinal and was leading 6-1, 1-1 when Sornlaksup retired from the match, giving Miyoshi an early entry to the finals.
In the finals, Miyoshi dominated the first set. Of the six games he won en route to a 6-2 victory, he held his opponent to 15 or fewer four times. Although he ended up falling 7-5 in the second set, Miyoshi put up an extremely respectable effort and even had the game knotted at 40-40 during set-point. 
Entering the final set of the tournament, Miyoshi lost the first game on back-to-back double faults. Despite this being an extremely demoralizing position to be in, Miyoshi rebounded with some of his best tennis as an Illini that was capped off by an ace which brought the score to 4-1. From there, Miyoshi was in the driver’s seat and cruised to an eventual 6-3 victory which crowned him champion of the Milwaukee Tennis Classic.
“Kenta’s the story of Milwaukee,” Dancer said. “He’s living and breathing our program, he’s milking it for everything it’s worth, and that’s what we want out of our guys. It’s skill sessions and extra fitness and extra stretching and extra meditation, those things pay off. When you’re doing all those things and then you compete like an animal, which he does, you get a lot better.”

Following a spring season that saw Illinois men’s tennis earn an overall record of 19-11, combined with a 6-3 mark against Big Ten opponents, head coach Brad Dancer and his squad will kick off their fall schedule with competitions in San Francisco and Milwaukee. Six of the 11 members on Illinois’ roster will be competing.
The draws for both tournaments have not been publicly released, but Dancer will be accompanying senior Alex Petrov and junior Karlis Ozolins to California while assistant coach Tim Kopinski makes the trip to Wisconsin with redshirt senior Lucas Horve, sophomore Kenta Miyoshi, sophomore Tyler Bowers and freshman Jeremy Zhang. 
At the Battle in the Bay, Petrov and Ozolins will be competing for a wild card entry into $100k Tiburon Men’s ATP Challenger Tournament and $80k Fairfield Men’s ATP Challenger Tournament, granted to the winner of the men’s singles event and men’s Saturday night shootout event.
Tournament matches begin on Thursday, with the Wild Card Shootout event on Saturday and the finals match on Sunday. Petrov is coming off a quarterfinal appearance in the Neitzel Family Open’s singles draw.
Up north, the main draw for singles and doubles will kick off on Friday. Two rounds of singles will be played on both Friday and Saturday, culminating in the finals on Sunday. There is just one doubles round on Friday, but the rest of the schedule is identical for that draw. 


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Miyoshi is also coming off a deep run at the Neitzel Family Open, where he advanced to the doubles final with partner Zeke Clark. 
There is a clear split in experience between the two groups, with the San Francisco duo being composed of two upperclassmen while three of the four Milwaukee attendees are underclassmen. This weekend will be Zhang’s first time ever representing Illinois, on top of it also being Bowers’ first time suiting up since suffering an injury in November 2022. 
Being two of the biggest unknowns on Illinois’ roster at this point, this weekend will be key in shaping where Bowers and Zhang go from here on out.
“Jeremy, we haven’t seen him play that much,” Dancer said. “We’re just kind of getting going, so I think these are initial times for us to assess with him and see where he’s ready to go. Bowers, he ended up getting a medical redshirt this last year because he got injured and was not able to play. He’s still kind of working himself back from that hand injury, but I think he’s at a place where he is ready to demonstrate his level too. I think both of those guys can have great weekends.” 
This season features one of the lowest possible turnover rates a program could ask for, with just one difference between the current roster and last season’s. Though it’s early, the additional camaraderie has been a noticeable bonus.
“I think guys are close right now,” Dancer said. “They’re confident in what they’re doing, and we’ve got a good group. Now it’s a matter of coaches putting all that together.”

In a weekend doubleheader that saw Illini hockey (3-1) face off against Purdue Northwest (2-2), Illinois was shut out and lost by a combined total of 9-0. Friday night was Illinois’ first away game of the season, traveling to Kube Sports Complex in Indiana after picking up a combination of in-state and conference victories to start the season. The Illini’s most recent appearance was a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Michigan State compared to Purdue Northwest’s most recent pair of 5-0 losses to Adrian College.
It was a tough start for the Illini on both ends of the ice, and by the end of the first period, they trailed 3-0. Although Illinois contained its opponents more effectively in the second period, Purdue Northwest tacked on another goal after eight minutes. Illinois was unable to get past Purdue Northwest’s goalie, sophomore Cooper Olson, who made 15 saves on 15 shots. Despite the scoreboard, the Illini goalies were not making it easy, as senior Ben Mazurek and junior Nolan Woodring spent time in front of the net and racked up 28 saves each. 
When it was all said and done, Purdue Northwest shut out Illinois en route to a 6-0 victory. Fortunately for the Illini, a shot at redemption in front of the home crowd was just 24 hours away.
However, early into round two, Illinois was in another hole after giving up a goal within the first three minutes of the game. That ended up being the lone goal of the first period, but Purdue Northwest put an incredible amount of pressure on Illinois’ net and totaled 19 shots by the first buzzer.
Halfway through the second period, Illinois and Purdue Northwest traded power plays. Illinois was the first to be one man up but was unable to capitalize on the advantage. A penalty on junior defenseman Nick Andersen flipped the script and gave Purdue Northwest its own power play. Within seconds, Purdue Northwest scored to increase its lead to 2-0. 


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Missed opportunities on special teams continued to pile up for Illinois in the third period, and Purdue Northwest ultimately tacked on a late third goal to end with a score of 3-0. 
Purdue Northwest improved to 4-2 on the season and will face Indiana Tech next week, while Illinois dropped to 3-3 and is gearing up for a two-game slate at Iowa State next weekend.

Last year may have been a season to forget for Illini hockey, but it would not be known from its 3-1 start to the new season. After compiling only 12 points over the course of 21 games last season, the Illini have jumped out to 8 early points, including a sweep of Northern Illinois two weeks ago and a split with Michigan State last weekend.
Ben Mazurek, club president and starting goalie, says this success was in the making all offseason.
“We’ve had a lot of strong new guys coming in,” Mazurek said. “We’re more connected than before. We’re playing well together as a team.”
That statement could not be more true, as the Illini have racked up 15 assists on 12 goals so far this season for an assist-to-goal ratio of 1.25:1, outpacing its total from last season.

The Illini are led in this charge by senior forward Alexander Matveev, with five points, and sophomore forward Gregory Etingen, with six points. Both are on pace to more than double their scoring output from last season.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

“Those guys had a great summer,” Mazurek said. “They came back better than before, and we’re seeing the reward of that. They just keep putting points on the board.”
The defense has struggled a bit out of the gate, but that is to be expected when five of the eight defensemen to appear in a game are brand new to the team. Normally, this would result in excess goals, but that has not been the case for the Illini.

Out of all Division I goalies who have seen as many shots on goal as Mazurek, he ranks first in saves and save percentage, with 111 and .957 respectively.
“It’s my last year, so I had to have a good summer,” Mazurek said. “I was training hard, so I think that’s paying off.”
Speaking on his leadership, which is leading to better play, Mazurek did not waste his chance to praise the team.
“It’s not just me, you know,” Mazurek said. “Woody (junior goalie Nolan Woodring) and I are playing great and just doing whatever we can to support the team.”
The Illini look to keep its foot on the gas as it plays a home-and-home series this weekend against Purdue University Northwest. The games are at 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, with the latter hosted at the Ice Arena. 
The Pride of Purdue NW come into this weekend at 2-2 after a season where they finished 21-6 and were ranked No. 15 in the final American Collegiate Hockey Association rankings. 
The Purdue NW offense tends to spread the wealth, but that could change after getting shut out in back-to-back games by Adrian College last weekend. This is the first time in a while that the Illini go into a series with the general public expecting a win. With expectations comes pressure, but Mazurek believes that pressure is nothing the team cannot handle.
“Every team you play is a good team, so you have to come in expecting to play hard, and you can’t take any week easy,” Mazurek said. “We play every week like we’re playing the top team in the country, so I think we’re ready.” 
With that mentality and the talent the Illini possess, fans could be in for a competitive series this weekend.

Senior Crystal Wang swings her club during the Illini Invitational at the Medinah Country Club. The Illini finished sixth.
By Andre Thomas, Staff Writer October 15, 2021
The Illinois women’s golf team concluded their own invitational with a tie at sixth place this week, making it the first time this year where they did not place in the top five.  The Illini invitational was held at the 72-hole Medinah Country Club where Georgia and Louisville both scored 849 points for the tie at first place. Both Kent State and Illinois were finished with 858 points behind Georgia, Purdue, Louisville, LSU, AND San Jose State
 This 15-team tournament is just the second last one of the Illinois seasons before their next invitational at the Columbia Classic in February. Illinois racked up a total of 858 points after three rounds, despite the rain preventing them to play for a short period of time on Monday morning.
Illinois Senior Crystal Wang lead the team in positions taking a 13th place tie in the last round with two scores over 70 in the final two rounds.   Illinois spent the first round of the event, hovering between second and third before receiving fourth-place finish at the end of the day, following Siyan Chen and Wang getting fifth and eighth place at the end of the second round.  However, the real story was how freshman Lexanne Halama had her best finish this week with a tie at 23rd place in the last few rounds.
This is the first time this year the Illinois has been out of the top five, which is a better start that last year and exactly what head coach Renee Stone was hoping for.  Illinois preseason expectations and golfers to watch list is still waiting to see whether three fellow illini deserved to be on there. Chen received a 37th place finish with scores of 78 and 71, keeping Illinois in everyone’s vision. Senior Kornkamol Sukaree was tied for 69th after Tuesday’s concluding rounds, which means the three golfers to watch this season are making noise. 
Illinois will end part one of their season on Oct. 29-31 when they travel to Wilmington, North Carolina for the Landfall Tradition. This 18-team invitational will be from Friday to Saturday and the last event before Illinois begins its race to the NCAA Championships.

Senior Crystal Wang swings her club during the Illini Invitational at the Medinah Country Club. The Illini finished sixth.
The Illinois women’s golf team concluded their own invitational with a tie at sixth place this week, making it the first time this year where they did not place in the top five.  The Illini invitational was held at the 72-hole Medinah Country Club where Georgia and Louisville both scored 849 points for the tie at first place. Both Kent State and Illinois were finished with 858 points behind Georgia, Purdue, Louisville, LSU, AND San Jose State
 This 15-team tournament is just the second last one of the Illinois seasons before their next invitational at the Columbia Classic in February. Illinois racked up a total of 858 points after three rounds, despite the rain preventing them to play for a short period of time on Monday morning.
Illinois Senior Crystal Wang lead the team in positions taking a 13th place tie in the last round with two scores over 70 in the final two rounds.   Illinois spent the first round of the event, hovering between second and third before receiving fourth-place finish at the end of the day, following Siyan Chen and Wang getting fifth and eighth place at the end of the second round.  However, the real story was how freshman Lexanne Halama had her best finish this week with a tie at 23rd place in the last few rounds.
This is the first time this year the Illinois has been out of the top five, which is a better start that last year and exactly what head coach Renee Stone was hoping for.  Illinois preseason expectations and golfers to watch list is still waiting to see whether three fellow illini deserved to be on there. Chen received a 37th place finish with scores of 78 and 71, keeping Illinois in everyone’s vision. Senior Kornkamol Sukaree was tied for 69th after Tuesday’s concluding rounds, which means the three golfers to watch this season are making noise. 
Illinois will end part one of their season on Oct. 29-31 when they travel to Wilmington, North Carolina for the Landfall Tradition. This 18-team invitational will be from Friday to Saturday and the last event before Illinois begins its race to the NCAA Championships.

Illinois soccer traveled to Elizabeth Lyle Robbie Stadium to face the Minnesota Golden Gophers on Sunday. After a good early start for the Illini, they failed to build on it throughout the game and faced the consequences.
It was a match heavily dominated by the Gophers overall, but the Illini started off strong with a goal in the fourth minute. A well-taken corner by junior defender Ella Karolak was connected to by sophomore midfielder Lia Howard, who continued her purple patch with a well-taken, right-footed strike past graduate goalkeeper Megan Plaschko into the bottom left corner.
The Gophers responded in the eighth minute with a nice one-two passing play on the edge of the box that resulted in a shot by senior midfielder Sophia Boman to the top of the net, which was tipped over the crossbar by senior goalkeeper Julia Cili.
Minnesota continued threatening the Illinois goal with a corner that was initially well-defended by the Illini, but the resulting clearance led to a hopeful ball back into the box, which was headed wide from point-blank range by senior midfielder Sophia Romine — a let-off for the Illini.
The Gophers eventually equalized in the 15th minute. A good turn in the midfield led to a line-breaking through ball to graduate forward Megan Nemec, whose one-on-one attempt was well-saved by Cili, but the rebound fell into the path of graduate forward Izzy Brown, who could not miss from a yard out.

The Gophers went ahead minutes later after a mistake by sophomore defender Ellen Persson, which led to Nemec driving down the right sideline before whipping in a low ball across the box that was passed into the bottom left corner by Romine.
The Illini fought hard but massively struggled to take control of the match. Despite a few good saves by Cili to keep it a one-goal deficit, the Gophers increased their lead a few minutes from full-time. A switch-off in defense allowed Nemec to dribble into the box unchallenged before playing a ball across for Romine to tap it in for her second goal of the match. Final score: Illinois 1, Minnesota 3.
The Illini hoped for better coming into this match after losing to the Ohio State Buckeyes, but it was not to be. This result brings their overall season record to 5-5-3 and their conference record to 1-3-2. Illinois looks for a bounce-back performance on Thursday against Wisconsin at Demirjian Park.

Illinois soccer headed to Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium to face Ohio State on Sunday. After a hard-fought second half performance, Illinois failed to overturn the deficit created by the Buckeyes.
In a match that started back and forth, the Illini nearly took the lead 11 minutes in through senior forward Makala Woods. Good link-up play led to a shot inside the box, which was comfortably saved by Prichard of the Buckeyes.
In a sucker-punch move, the Buckeyes scored off a counterattack through star player Amanda Schlueter, who received the ball on the left wing and cut inside to smash the ball past senior goalkeeper Julia Cili into the bottom left corner. It was from then on that the game shifted toward the Buckeyes.
In the 20th minute, Cili came up clutch for the Illini by making an acrobatic diving save from an Emma Sears header to tip the ball over the net. It was Sears who was a thorn in the side of Illinois in the first half, who once again troubled the defense in the 25th minute to dribble past junior defender Ella Karolak into the six-yard box, and took a shot past Cili which hit the crossbar.
The Buckeyes troubled Illinois once again in the 30th minute through Schlueter who drove through the Illini midfield to feed the ball to Dudukovich, who took a touch into the box and slotted it past Cili into the bottom right corner, 2-0 Ohio State.

The Illini immediately responded through freshman defender Mya Archibald, who had a low driven shot on the right side of the box saved by the legs of the in-form Pritchard.
Illinois showed fight in the second half, putting the Buckeyes on notice. In the 58th minute, a nice flick from Archibald sets up the pass for Makala Woods on the edge of the Ohio State box, who takes a snapshot that fizzes over the bar.
Seventy minutes in, further pressuring the Buckeyes defense, junior defender Angie Galo crossed the ball low from the righthand side to the edge of the box, which was shot by sophomore forward Sarah Foley and saved again by Pritchard.
The Illini finally got their goal in the 83rd minute through sophomore midfielder Lia Howard, who takes a shot from 22 yards out that deflects off a Buckeye defender and flies in off the post.
The Illini threw everything at the Buckeyes, and almost had something to show for it five minutes from time. The now confident Howard found herself unmarked in the Ohio State box from graduate student defender Bel Rolley’s cross, which was headed narrowly wide.
The Illini weren’t able to find an equalizer late on, courtesy of missed chances and a strong Buckeye defensive performance. Final score: Illinois 1, Ohio State 2.
The Illini hoped for a better result, but were very happy with their second half display. This result moves the Illini to 5-4-2 on the season, and 1-2-2 in the conference. They hope for more on their trip to Minnesota next Sunday.

There weren’t any goals to be had on Thursday night as Illini soccer traveled north to play the Northwestern Wildcats. Illinois earned the road point in Evanston, bringing its conference record to 1-1-2.
The match was a defensive battle across both halves, though the visiting Illini nearly broke the deadlock early in the ninth minute. Following some link-up play in the middle of the pitch, senior forward Makala Woods did well to hold the ball high up the pitch, unleashing a well-weighted through ball to graduate student defender Bel Rolley, who fired off the shot only to see the attempt soar wide of the net.
The Wildcats then turned the tables on the Illini by pulling off an identical play on the other end of the pitch. Senior goalkeeper Julia Cili was called into action in the 24th minute after Northwestern split Illinois’ defense with a cutting pass. Cili, who has come up clutch in one-on-one situations multiple times this season, rushed out to make the save and got a foot on the ball.
On the brink of halftime, the Illini created another chance off of a set piece, with freshman defender Mya Archibald having her header stopped on the line by the Wildcats’ keeper.
Coming out of the break, Northwestern threatened to take the lead in the 48th minute before Cili made her second one-on-one save of the night. The Wildcats were first to the deflection before junior defender Ella Karolak stepped up to block what would have been a sure-fire goal for the home side.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Cili completed her hat trick of one-on-one saves in the 60th minute after Northwestern managed to get the ball into wide-open space on the left wing. Arguably the senior’s most impressive stop of the evening, Cili proved to be crucial once again in earning a result for the Illini.
The match concluded without a goal as the combination of missed chances and strong defending resulted in a somewhat anticlimactic draw between the two in-state rivals. Final score: Illinois 0, Northwestern 0.
Earning a point from Evanston is far from a bad result for the Illini, though the squad will be hoping for more out of its trip to Columbus up next. Illinois will be back in action at 11 a.m. CT on Sunday for a clash with Ohio State searching for its second conference victory and sixth overall win this season.

Illinois soccer will be traveling to Northwestern on Thursday with some wind in its sails after picking up its first conference victory of the season. In search of their sixth overall win of 2023, the Illini are preparing for a Wildcats team that currently holds a 72.7% win percentage this year.
The squad showed their grit against No. 19 Michigan on Sunday, pulling off a 2-1 upset for their second ranked victory of the season. The Illini outdueled the Wolverines in a match that demonstrated the team’s ability to compete in the Big Ten, something they’ve struggled to do over the past few years.
“Now you have to show that kind of performance on a consistent basis,” said head coach Janet Rayfield following the win over Michigan. “We challenged them to do that in the second half. I think when a team’s behind they come out and do different things and we certainly battled that, but we’ve got to come back out on Thursday on the road now and play that exact same kind of soccer.”
Putting together two complete halves is easier said than done, and it’s something the Illini have strived to do. The momentum of Sunday will undoubtedly be fueling the squad as they travel to Evanston, but the trick will be maintaining focus against a Northwestern team that holds a 7-2-2 overall record. However, the Wildcats haven’t enjoyed the strongest start to Big Ten play, having won their conference opener against the Purdue Boilermakers before dropping their next two matches against the Wolverines and the Indiana Hoosiers.
The last meeting between Illinois and Northwestern took place last season in Champaign, where the then No. 8 ranked Wildcats dominated the Illini in a 4-0 drumming. The Illini will be looking for revenge against their in-state rivals, this time having to compete in front of a sea of purple.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

One area of concern that Illinois will need to watch for is Northwestern’s attack. While the Wildcats are currently on a two-game losing streak, they’ve won games by pretty significant margins this season. Some of these results include a season opening 4-0 victory over Marquette, a 7-0 annihilation of Oakland and a 4-1 win over Weber State. The Wildcats know how to put the ball in the back of the net, but luckily for the visiting Illini know how to stop it.
Senior goalkeeper Julia Cili has been one of the top performers for Illinois this season and showed it again against No. 19 Michigan on Sunday. Cili stopped four of the Wolverines’ five shots on target to help secure the win, continuing to prove her status as one of the top goalkeepers in the Big Ten.
Illinois (5-3-2 overall, 1-1-1 conference) will kickoff in Evanston against Northwestern (7-2-2, 1-2-0 conference) at 7 p.m. CT on Thursday. With a first Big Ten win under their belts, the Illini will be traveling north looking to build a win streak.

The last meeting between Illinois and Northwestern took place last season in Champaign, where the then No. 8 ranked Wildcats dominated the Illini in a 4-0 drumming. The Illini will be looking for revenge against their in-state rivals, this time having to compete in front of a sea of purple.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

One area of concern that Illinois will need to watch for is Northwestern’s attack. While the Wildcats are currently on a two-game losing streak, they’ve won games by pretty significant margins this season. Some of these results include a season opening 4-0 victory over Marquette, a 7-0 annihilation of Oakland and a 4-1 win over Weber State. The Wildcats know how to put the ball in the back of the net, but luckily for the visiting Illini know how to stop it.
Senior goalkeeper Julia Cili has been one of the top performers for Illinois this season and showed it again against No. 19 Michigan on Sunday. Cili stopped four of the Wolverines’ five shots on target to help secure the win, continuing to prove her status as one of the top goalkeepers in the Big Ten.
Illinois (5-3-2 overall, 1-1-1 conference) will kickoff in Evanston against Northwestern (7-2-2, 1-2-0 conference) at 7 p.m. CT on Thursday. With a first Big Ten win under their belts, the Illini will be traveling north looking to build a win streak.

The Illini walk the field during post-game after beating Michigan 3-2.
The Illini play against Northwestern this coming Thursday.
Illinois soccer will be traveling to Northwestern on Thursday with some wind in its sails after picking up its first conference victory of the season. In search of their sixth overall win of 2023, the Illini are preparing for a Wildcats team that currently holds a 72.7% win percentage this year.
The squad showed their grit against No. 19 Michigan on Sunday, pulling off a 2-1 upset for their second ranked victory of the season. The Illini outdueled the Wolverines in a match that demonstrated the team’s ability to compete in the Big Ten, something they’ve struggled to do over the past few years.
“Now you have to show that kind of performance on a consistent basis,” said head coach Janet Rayfield following the win over Michigan. “We challenged them to do that in the second half. I think when a team’s behind they come out and do different things and we certainly battled that, but we’ve got to come back out on Thursday on the road now and play that exact same kind of soccer.”
Putting together two complete halves is easier said than done, and it’s something the Illini have strived to do. The momentum of Sunday will undoubtedly be fueling the squad as they travel to Evanston, but the trick will be maintaining focus against a Northwestern team that holds a 7-2-2 overall record. However, the Wildcats haven’t enjoyed the strongest start to Big Ten play, having won their conference opener against the Purdue Boilermakers before dropping their next two matches against the Wolverines and the Indiana Hoosiers.

It was a hot, sunny day at Demirjian Park on Sunday as the Illini (5-3-2) defeated the No. 19 Michigan Wolverines (6-2-2) by a score of 2-1. While the final was a one-goal difference, the Illini dominated for much of the game, their most complete showing of the year thus far.
“The first half was, I think, one of the best halves of soccer we’ve played in a long time,” said head coach Janet Rayfield. “(I’m) proud of our team for bouncing back from a, I think, disappointing performance on Thursday.”
The Illini were on the attack early, outhustling the Wolverines on seemingly every play. The ball rarely crossed onto the Wolverine side of the pitch, with the Illini tallying 11 more shots and seven more corners than their opponent in the first half. Senior forward Makala Woods sparked the offensive surge, creating numerous early chances.
Seven minutes into the game, Woods found herself all alone, streaking toward the goal, but one too many dribbles allowed the keeper to leave the net and grab the ball. The senior put the passive play in the back of her mind and began to pepper the Wolverine goalie with shots. After two shots hit the post and the goalies outstretched hands respectively, Woods found the back of the net with a ground ball on the right side.
“She’s got the pace that can really threaten back lines,” said Rayfield. “She’s been kind of hanging out in the middle a little bit, and we really talked to her about trying to threaten those spaces, and she did a great job.”

It was the first goal the Wolverines had allowed in three matches, and the Illini weren’t finished. Keeping the pressure, the Illini took shots, forcing a Wolverine penalty in the box with 19 minutes remaining in the first half. Sophomore forward Sarah Foley was called upon in the big moment, and she delivered.
Her shot up the middle was deflected, and everyone began to crash on the ball. Foley was the first one there and tapped in an easy shot for the 2-0 lead. The goalie didn’t have a shot at the second attempt, following her first of four saves on the day.
“I’ve been practicing this PK, but I guess it was pretty easy to read that time,” Foley stated. “Thankfully, she blocked it right back to the middle to me and let me get a second chance.”
The remainder of the first half went by quickly, with the Illini threatening one final time. Graduate student forward Makena Silber drove a ball towards the upper left corner, but the Wolverine goalie made her best save of the game, lifting the ball with her fingertips above the crossbar.
As the teams took the field in the second half, it was more of the same. The Illini continued to be on the offensive, but both squads showed a noticeable increase in physicality. A couple of no-calls following collisions drew jeers from both fanbases, with two notable ones getting the fans fired up.
Sophomore midfielder Lia Howard earned a yellow card in the 65th minute during a quick scuffle that ended in the ball being kicked into a Wolverine midfielder’s face. With the Wolverines letting the officials hear it, the Illini got their chance in the 79th minute. A collision on the Illini side of the field left Woods down on the ground, clutching her midsection. The forward was removed from the game and taken straight to the locker room with a trainer.
The play sucked some momentum and energy out of the park, just what the Wolverines needed. After nearly 80 minutes of being backed up against their own goal, they began attacking and got some great looks. After a big opportunity saw a Wolverine fall in the box, no call was rewarded. The Illini did not escape for long, however, as the Wolverines were finally awarded a penalty within striking distance.
As the clock reached the 86th minute, the Wolverines executed a 30-yard free kick to perfection, with a header finding the right side of the goal. It was too little too late for the Wolverines, though, as they never got another good chance to score.
“Now we know what we are capable of,” Foley said. “We just got to know how to play the best we can play … We can come out next game knowing we are capable of this and better.”

After returning home on Thursday to a narrow loss against Indiana, Illinois soccer are hungry to jump back in the win column as it prepares to take the pitch against No. 19 Michigan on Sunday. The Wolverines will be difficult to earn a result against, but the Illini possess home field advantage at Demirjian Park.
“This Big Ten, from one to however many teams we have right now, is gonna be a dog fight,” said head coach Janet Rayfield. “I don’t think it matters who’s won games and who’s lost games, every game is going to be a fight. Our team needs to know that when the whistle blows and the lights come on, it’s game on and I’m sure it will be on Sunday with Michigan.”
Rayfield’s squad enters off a loss and a draw in their last two matches. The start of the 2023 Big Ten schedule hasn’t been easy for Illinois, with a 1-1 draw against undefeated Iowa and a 2-1 defeat to unbeaten Indiana serving as the team’s first two conference results.
Still searching for their first Big Ten triumph of the season, the Illini must now welcome a ranked Wolverines side to Champaign. Illinois has lost its last four encounters with Michigan, the most recent result being a 2-1 overtime loss back in 2021. Historically, the Illini trail in the all-time series against the Wolverines with a 9-18-1 record. The current Michigan squad has begun conference play strong, winning their opening two matches against Minnesota and No. 18 Northwestern by 1-0 and 2-0 score lines, respectively.
One of the highlights of Illinois’ squad has been the rise of junior midfielder Sydney Stephens. The Waterloo native has been one of the team’s most in-form attackers. With four goals in nine appearances so far, Stephens has played a crucial role in finding the difficult goals for Illinois in 2023.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

On the other end of the pitch, senior goalkeeper Julia Cili has stood out for the Illini. In eight appearances so far, Cili has recorded a staggering 45 saves. She recorded a season-high nine saves in back-to-back matches against Pepperdine and Iowa, and most recently the senior made six stops against Indiana on Thursday. Both Stephens’ and Cili’s services have proven vital to helping the Illini earn results this season, and they’ll be crucial if the squad hopes to win points against the Wolverines next.
Illinois (4-3-2 overall, 0-1-1 conference) kicks off against No. 19 Michigan (6-1-2 overall, 2-0-0 conference) at 1 p.m. on Sunday in Champaign. The Illini have a chance to turn things around with an upset over the Wolverines and hand the visitors their first Big Ten defeat of 2023.

The Illini returned to Champaign on Thursday night for their first home conference matchup of 2023. Despite a late resurgence from Illinois offensively, the squad was unable to overcome the deficit, falling to the visitors by a 2-1 defeat.
“A game of two halves for us,” said head coach Janet Rayfield. “Disappointed in our performance in the first half, we didn’t really come out with the kind of fight that it takes to win a Big Ten game. You can’t fight for 45 minutes and win a Big Ten game, either.”
The match opened with a defensive battle between the two sides. The Illini made some important stops, but a mistake at the back in the 18th minute allowed the Hoosiers to gain possession close to the net and fire home the opening goal of the night.
The Illini found their response in the 34th minute. Junior midfielder Sydney Stephens beat her marker one-on-one down the right wing before launching a well-placed shot into the far left corner to equalize. Stephens has been on fire for Illinois this season, with her equalizer serving as her fourth goal in nine matches in 2023.
“Stephens just works really hard and creates things by her effort and her desire to win,” Rayfield said. “That shows she picks the ball up and tries to make something happen. She’s been able to do that and got us back into the game and we should rally behind that. She certainly has this incredible inner fight and desire and she’s making things happen because of that.”

Despite Stephens’ equalizer, Indiana wasn’t finished, regaining the lead a mere five minutes later. After an initial save by senior goalkeeper Julia Cili, the Hoosiers managed to get to the rebound and clean up in the box from close range. The two sides headed into the break with the Illini trailing by one.
The second half saw Illinois push higher up the pitch, creating countless opportunities particularly near the end of the match. It was a very different showing than the first half, as the home side were now fully in control, sparking quick, attacking possessions and working to get the ball into the Hoosier box. The Illini came close to leveling the score on numerous occasions, but to the dismay of the fans, an equalizer wasn’t meant to be for Rayfield’s squad as the final whistle was blown at Demirjian Park. Final score: Illinois 1, Indiana 2.
“I loved our fight in the second half,” Rayfield said. “We created the kind of chances we needed to to put ourselves back in the game, but you can’t put yourself down a couple goals and not fight for balls when a team’s coming into your hometown. Tale of two halves, disappointed in the first one and proud of coming back and fighting in the second one.”
The Illini will be back at home at 1 p.m. on Sunday as it welcomes the No. 19 Michigan Wolverines to Champaign. It will be a huge test for Rayfield’s team as they hunt for their first Big Ten victory of 2023.

Despite Stephens’ equalizer, Indiana wasn’t finished, regaining the lead a mere five minutes later. After an initial save by senior goalkeeper Julia Cili, the Hoosiers managed to get to the rebound and clean up in the box from close range. The two sides headed into the break with the Illini trailing by one.
The second half saw Illinois push higher up the pitch, creating countless opportunities particularly near the end of the match. It was a very different showing than the first half, as the home side were now fully in control, sparking quick, attacking possessions and working to get the ball into the Hoosier box. The Illini came close to leveling the score on numerous occasions, but to the dismay of the fans, an equalizer wasn’t meant to be for Rayfield’s squad as the final whistle was blown at Demirjian Park. Final score: Illinois 1, Indiana 2.
“I loved our fight in the second half,” Rayfield said. “We created the kind of chances we needed to to put ourselves back in the game, but you can’t put yourself down a couple goals and not fight for balls when a team’s coming into your hometown. Tale of two halves, disappointed in the first one and proud of coming back and fighting in the second one.”
The Illini will be back at home at 1 p.m. on Sunday as it welcomes the No. 19 Michigan Wolverines to Champaign. It will be a huge test for Rayfield’s team as they hunt for their first Big Ten victory of 2023.

Junior midfielder Sydney Stephens dribbles past Indiana defenders on Thursday.
The Illini returned to Champaign on Thursday night for their first home conference matchup of 2023. Despite a late resurgence from Illinois offensively, the squad was unable to overcome the deficit, falling to the visitors by a 2-1 defeat.
“A game of two halves for us,” said head coach Janet Rayfield. “Disappointed in our performance in the first half, we didn’t really come out with the kind of fight that it takes to win a Big Ten game. You can’t fight for 45 minutes and win a Big Ten game, either.”
The match opened with a defensive battle between the two sides. The Illini made some important stops, but a mistake at the back in the 18th minute allowed the Hoosiers to gain possession close to the net and fire home the opening goal of the night.
The Illini found their response in the 34th minute. Junior midfielder Sydney Stephens beat her marker one-on-one down the right wing before launching a well-placed shot into the far left corner to equalize. Stephens has been on fire for Illinois this season, with her equalizer serving as her fourth goal in nine matches in 2023.
“Stephens just works really hard and creates things by her effort and her desire to win,” Rayfield said. “That shows she picks the ball up and tries to make something happen. She’s been able to do that and got us back into the game and we should rally behind that. She certainly has this incredible inner fight and desire and she’s making things happen because of that.”
Despite Stephens’ equalizer, Indiana wasn’t finished, regaining the lead a mere five minutes later.

It’s Big Ten time in Champaign for the Illini, who will continue its conference campaign on Thursday night with a matchup against the Hoosiers. Illinois opened Big Ten play with a point on the road against Iowa on Sunday and will be looking to build momentum against a strong Indiana side.
A lone goal from graduate student forward Makena Silber was enough to earn a draw against the undefeated Hawkeyes in the Illini’s last outing. With her goal on Sunday, the veteran moved up to eighth in Illinois’ all-time scoring list, tied with Colleen Joyce. After missing the entirety of the 2022 season due to injury, Silber will serve as an important piece of the Illini attack in conference play. The Crystal Lake native has scored 21 career goals and counting.
“We’re all super excited to get off on another foot this season,” Silber said heading into conference play. “We’re looking to bounce back from some things in conference the past two years and I think we have a great group. There’s just something different and special about this group.”
While it’s true that the Illini have struggled to compete for the Big Ten title in recent seasons, there is reason to believe in the current squad. Illinois began the year with three wins and a draw in its opening four matches, its best start to a season since 2015. Currently sitting with a 4-2-2 record after eight games, things have slowed down for the squad but a fresh start to conference play has arrived.
Like against Iowa, Illinois will be squaring off against another undefeated Big Ten foe. Indiana currently holds an impressive 7-0-2 overall record, with its most recent result being a 3-2 conference victory over Rutgers.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Historically, the Illini are ahead in the head-to-head matchup against the Hoosiers, with 14 wins to the latter’s eight. However, Indiana was victorious the last time the two programs clashed back in 2021 after a tightly fought game that saw the Hoosiers earn a narrow 2-1 win in Bloomington.
It won’t be easy, but Illinois has the squad to pull off a memorable result against its Big Ten neighbors. The Illini faithful will have the chance to witness the team’s first conference game of 2023 in what is an exciting matchup between two strong programs. Both teams will take the pitch on Thursday night for a 7 p.m. kickoff at Demirjian Park.
“I think we’re all just super excited to show up,” Silber said, “Take it day-by-day and focus on the process of it. The results will come if we just keep digging our heels in.”

Illinois soccer traveled to Iowa on Sunday for its first conference clash of 2023 with a week’s worth of rest and the momentum of an exciting senior day victory fueling the squad. The Illini and the Hawkeyes shared the honors to open Big Ten play with a 1-1 result from Iowa City.
The match opened with strong defensive performances from both teams. Senior goalkeeper Julia Cili faced her first real test of the match in the 27th minute, tipping a dangerous shot from distance over the bar to keep the score level.
Not long after, graduate student forward Makena Silber opened the scoring for Illinois in the 31st minute. The Crystal Lake native was able to pounce on a poor pass by the Hawkeyes, dribbling past the goalkeeper to fire home the first goal of the match. The goal served as Silber’s 21st career goal, moving the forward into a tie for eighth place with Colleen Joyce on the Illini’s all-time scoring list. Illinois 1, Iowa 0.
The visitors closed out the first half with a one-goal lead. Both sides continued their tight battle coming out of the break, with senior midfielder Kennedy Berschel nearly increasing Illinois’ advantage to two in the 58th minute. After receiving the ball at the top of the box, Berschel drove into the middle of the pitch and fired off a low shot toward the bottom left corner only to see the shot saved at the last second.
Cili continued her great form on Sunday and ended the match with nine total saves. The senior pulled off arguably her most important stop of the night in the 76th minute, catching a rocket shot from the Hawkeyes that was on its way into the top right corner of the net.

Iowa wasn’t finished, however, and found its late equalizer in the 84th minute of the game. Hawkeyes forward Elle Otto was able to beat her marker on the right wing, sending in a cross to the far corner that was headed home by Kelli McGroarty to level the score. Neither side were able to find the game winner, splitting the points at one each. Final score: Illinois 1, Iowa 1.
Illinois had the opportunity to sneak away with all three points, but with Big Ten competition serving as a bit of an Achilles heel for the program in recent years, a tie comes as a decent start to conference play. The Illini now find themselves 4-2-2 on the season after their showdown with the undefeated Hawkeyes.
Illinois will be returning to Champaign for its conference home opener against Indiana. The match kicks off at 7 p.m. on Thursday night as the Illini hunt for their first Big Ten triumph of the year.

To leave any sort of legacy behind at an NCAA program is no easy feat, and graduate student forward Makena Silber has certainly left her mark on Illinois soccer’s program. After five seasons with the Illini, the Crystal Lake native will be remembered as one of the greatest forwards to wear the orange and blue, currently tied with Colleen Joyce for the eighth most goals in program history.
Silber has been no stranger to scoring goals for Illinois, with the forward amassing 21 career goals and seven game-winners in 71 starts. Despite this achievement, chasing scoring records is not something Silber focuses on.
“I think any college athlete hopes to leave an impact on the program that they played for, and on the people they get to interact with on a daily basis,” Silber said. “As much as (individual achievements) are valuable to me, I really try not to think about that as much as ‘What can I do on a day-to-day basis to really leave a good impression?ʼ”
Silber’s journey kicked off to a strong start, with the forward scoring five goals in her debut season with the Illini in 2018. As a freshman, she started 17 matches and led the team with 46 shots. Needless to say, the foundation of Silber’s collegiate career was paved from the beginning, with one memory in particular standing out to the graduate student.
“We beat Duke when they were ranked my freshman year,” Silber said. “It was my first collegiate game and my first collegiate goal. I think that will rank as one of the highest (memories).”


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Silber continued to prove her ability in the attack each season, scoring six goals in 18 games in 2019, three goals in 12 games in 2020-21 and five goals in 17 games in 2021. Along the way, the Crystal Lake native has earned a number of individual awards over her five years with the program, including 2018 Big Ten All-Freshman honors, 2020 United Soccer Coaches Third Team All-North Region honors and 2020 Third Team All-Big Ten honors.
Now a seasoned veteran on the current Illinois roster, Silber has taken on a leadership role within the squad. With the program having struggled in Big Ten play in recent years, the 2023 Illini are shooting for success in this season’s conference campaign. One step in achieving this involves “reinventing a culture” within the program, something Silber is helping to promote.
“It’s been really cool,” Silber said. “We’ve started doing culture meetings to have really honest and vulnerable conversations with one another because a big thing is building those relationships off the field so that they transfer onto the field.”
Despite being the most capped player on the roster, Silber has had no problem stepping back and allowing newer players to come in and impact the program. While the forward has utilized her experience to help lead her teammates on the pitch, she places heavy value on the fresh perspectives and ideas of her teammates. A lot of Silber’s leadership was on heavy display last year. After tearing her ACL and missing the entirety of the 2022 season, Silber had to take on a heavy leadership role from the sideline.
“Any time an athlete has a big injury like that, it forces a perspective shift,” Silber said. “I was able to take on a new role that I had never experienced before. It allowed me to see things that I might not have been able to see if I’d been able to play. I took on a player coach role and was able to support and help my teammates toward the things I know they’re capable of. It was really cool to have that perspective.”
With Silber now fully recovered and back on the field for Illinois in 2023, the graduate student is able to continue leading from the pitch. After half a decade of goals, leadership and memories, Silber’s impact on Illinois’ program cannot be questioned. As the current squad hunts for Big Ten success this season, Silber will be spearheading the Illini attack one last time.
“It sounds so cliché, but everything goes by so fast,” Silber said. “You just really remember the people that you had around you and the emotions that I’ve felt in joy, love and support. Iʼm fond of all of those memories and they’re attached to so many people that I’ve had the pleasure of knowing and continuing to know.”

Silber’s journey kicked off to a strong start, with the forward scoring five goals in her debut season with the Illini in 2018. As a freshman, she started 17 matches and led the team with 46 shots. Needless to say, the foundation of Silber’s collegiate career was paved from the beginning, with one memory in particular standing out to the graduate student.
“We beat Duke when they were ranked my freshman year,” Silber said. “It was my first collegiate game and my first collegiate goal. I think that will rank as one of the highest (memories).”
Silber continued to prove her ability in the attack each season, scoring six goals in 18 games in 2019, three goals in 12 games in 2020-21 and five goals in 17 games in 2021. Along the way, the Crystal Lake native has earned a number of individual awards over her five years with the program, including 2018 Big Ten All-Freshman honors, 2020 United Soccer Coaches Third Team All-North Region honors and 2020 Third Team All-Big Ten honors.
Now a seasoned veteran on the current Illinois roster, Silber has taken on a leadership role within the squad. With the program having struggled in Big Ten play in recent years, the 2023 Illini are shooting for success in this season’s conference campaign. One step in achieving this involves “reinventing a culture” within the program, something Silber is helping to promote.
“It’s been really cool,” Silber said. “We’ve started doing culture meetings to have really honest and vulnerable conversations with one another because a big thing is building those relationships off the field so that they transfer onto the field.”
Despite being the most capped player on the roster, Silber has had no problem stepping back and allowing newer players to come in and impact the program. While the forward has utilized her experience to help lead her teammates on the pitch, she places heavy value on the fresh perspectives and ideas of her teammates. A lot of Silber’s leadership was on heavy display last year. After tearing her ACL and missing the entirety of the 2022 season, Silber had to take on a heavy leadership role from the sideline.
“Any time an athlete has a big injury like that, it forces a perspective shift,” Silber said. “I was able to take on a new role that I had never experienced before. It allowed me to see things that I might not have been able to see if I’d been able to play. I took on a player coach role and was able to support and help my teammates toward the things I know they’re capable of. It was really cool to have that perspective.”
With Silber now fully recovered and back on the field for Illinois in 2023, the graduate student is able to continue leading from the pitch. After half a decade of goals, leadership and memories, Silber’s impact on Illinois’ program cannot be questioned. As the current squad hunts for Big Ten success this season, Silber will be spearheading the Illini attack one last time.
“It sounds so cliché, but everything goes by so fast,” Silber said. “You just really remember the people that you had around you and the emotions that I’ve felt in joy, love and support. Iʼm fond of all of those memories and they’re attached to so many people that I’ve had the pleasure of knowing and continuing to know.”

After an extensive five-game road trip, Illinois soccer returned home on Sunday to compete in front of the Illini fans for the first time since Aug. 17. The stands of Demirjian Park were full as the squad got set for a senior day clash against Pepperdine on a sunny day in Champaign.
“It feels fantastic (being back at home),” said senior goalkeeper Julia Cili. “Having family here, being in this environment, being captivated in all this energy from the stands, it’s awesome. God is so good, before the game we were all just praying, getting together and we really delivered. The energy was high, we wanted to get that win and we did everything possible.”
Ten players were honored, including seniors Julia Cili, Makala Woods, Mackenzie Schuler, Zoey Kollhoff, Joanna Verzosa-Dolezal, Julia Eichenbaum and Kennedy Berschel; with graduate students Makena Silber, Bel Rolley and Ashley Cathro also celebrating their final seasons with the program.
“Every class leaves their mark,” Rayfield said. “This class is no different, I think we celebrated 10 individuals today who all have something unique about them. If we can just take a piece of that, a little bit of their uniqueness and it’s already woven in the fabric of this program until we’ve been here for all infinity. That’s what’s really cool about our program, it’s made of the little bits and pieces of every player, every trainer, every coach and every fan who’s been a part of it. We carry it with us and especially these seniors here today.”
The match kicked off to a rough start for the Illini as the visitors broke the deadlock just 10 minutes into the game. The Waves were first to the ball off a corner for the early 1-0 advantage. The Illini didn’t falter, however, and continued pushing for an equalizer. Graduate student forward Silber nearly found it in the 22nd minute, forcing a great save after a long-range attempt.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

In the 33rd minute, great linkup play from the Illini led to senior forward Woods laying it off to junior midfielder Sydney Stephens in the box. Stephens coolly slotted it into the bottom left corner to get the Illini on the scoreboard. The two sides remained deadlocked heading into the break, with the sea of orange at Demirjian Park hungry to witness a winner.
“The atmosphere here cannot be beat,” Stephens said. “We’re really happy to be home, we have a limited amount of home games so when we’re here we know it really matters. We want to do it for our fans and the people who support us.”
Cili starred in the first half, making five big saves and pulling off crucial blocks in one-on-one situations. She finished the game with nine saves, as her heroics continued in the second half. Pepperdine had numerous opportunities from point blank range squandered by the senior goalkeeper, which ended up being crucial to the game’s final result.
Illinois earned a penalty kick in the 54th minute after a handball in the box. Senior midfielder Berschel stepped up to take but had her penalty saved; however, sophomore forward Sarah Foley was there to clean up and put the team ahead 2-1.
The Waves weren’t finished yet and equalized in the 73rd minute. Another breakaway saw the Waves finally beat Cili one-on-one to set up a nervy conclusion to the match.
Both teams fought to find the winner to no avail until the 88th minute of the contest. Berschel managed to find Woods on the wing after a great long ball, with Woods squaring it into Pepperdine’s box. Up stepped Stephens, who fired it home to send Demirjian Park into an absolute frenzy. The late winner capped off an exciting senior day victory in Champaign for the team’s most dramatic finish in 2023. Final score: Illinois 3, Pepperdine 2.
Stephens shined on the offensive end for the Illini as a constant presence in the attack. With two goals against the Waves, the junior played an instrumental role in turning the game around after the early one-goal deficit.
“We’ve been talking about near post runs for so long and how important they are,” Stephens said. “I think we just saw in (both goals) how important near post runs can be. I was just there to tap it in, but at the end of the day my teammates did the work and got it where it needed to be in front of the goal.”
Illinois (4-2-1) is off to a strong start in 2023 and will begin its Big Ten campaign next Sunday with a trip to Iowa City. The Hawkeyes (6-0-1) will serve as a tough test for Rayfield’s squad, but a prime opportunity to begin conference play on a high note. In the meantime, the Illini have reason to celebrate with a memorable senior day in the books.
“This program, it’s a family away from home,” Cili said. “It’s somebody who challenges me, challenges me to be better and seeing everybody and being able to love this team is an experience I wouldn’t trade for the world.”

It’s been a long journey on the road for Illinois, and head coach Janet Rayfield and her squad are ready to return to Champaign to compete in front of the Illini faithful once again. The team has spent the last five games on the road and came out with a 2-2-1 record.
Although the results haven’t been there recently, with the last two games ending in losses for Illinois, the squad started the season off strong. The Illini were undefeated in their opening four matches, earning their best start since 2015.
“Certainly this team is excited to be back home,” Rayfield said. “There’s a feeling of success around the team, and they’re excited to bring that back to the fans in Illinois and to showcase who they are and where they are. We’re certainly excited about that.”
It’s been a season of tight results so far as aside from the draw against Dayton, Illinois has won or lost all of its games by one goal. It will be an interesting test on Sunday as the squad prepares to take the pitch against a Pepperdine Waves team that has won twice and drawn on five occasions. Most recently, Pepperdine earned a 2-2 tie against LSU in its most recent fixture.
Demirjian Park will be hosting the third-ever meeting between the Illini and the Waves on Sunday. It will also be the first time the two sides meet in Champaign. Historically, the series is split 1-1-0, allowing both teams the chance to get ahead in the tie. It was Illinois who came out victorious in the most recent clash, a 3-2 triumph back in 2019 over a ranked Pepperdine squad.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

In addition to wanting to get back in the win column, the Illini program will be celebrating Senior Day. Seniors Julia Cili, Makala Woods, Mackenzie Schuler, Zoey Kollhoff, Joanna Verzosa-Dolezal, Julia Eichenbaum and Kennedy Berschel are on the list, with Makena Silber, Bel Rolley and Ashley Cathro serving as the graduate students on the roster.
Illinois will kickoff against Pepperdine at noon on Sunday. The Illini have a tough test ahead of them but have the pieces to secure a victory in Champaign. In what will be their first game at home since Aug. 17, Rayfield’s squad will be hungry to turn things around in front of the sea of orange at Demirjian Park.

Illinois softball kicked off its eight-game slate of fall exhibitions last Friday against Lake Land College. Two days later, the Illini were back on the field for the Illini Fall Classic, where they took both legs of a doubleheader against Wabash Valley and Kaskaskia. Through the three contests, Illinois outscored its opponents 42-6 and went 3-0. 
Originally scheduled for Thursday but pushed back due to inclement weather, Illinois’ season opener against Lake Land was not hindered by the scheduling hiccups. Hot bats combined with excellent pitching and only allowing “controllable” runs culminated in a blowout 12-2 victory for the Illini.
“Lake Land is a good team,” said head coach Tyra Perry. “They’re a junior college program, but they send players off into division one each year. We’ve had some players from their program. They are a team that will beat you if you mess around and don’t play high-quality softball.”
Fortunately, messing around and low-quality softball are not in Illinois’ DNA, as they did not slack on either end of the plate and the players were looking to score in every inning while bringing it all on the defensive end.
“I enjoyed the execution of our offense,” said Perry. “We executed signals, situational hitting. I thought we had a strong showing in that area and set the tone. On the pitching side, I thought our newcomer, Bri Bower, started us off with a strong note, Juliana Hooker came in and played a significant role and our freshman, Mallory Sluder, brought a lot to our game as well.”

There was no doubt on Friday, and just one inning into the Sunday slate, it was clear there would be no doubt once again. The Illini put three runs on the board in the bottom of the first before adding on three more in the second and two more in the third. Despite all of this, it was the fourth inning that was most impressive. Fifth-year outfielder Kelly Ryono started things off with a solo home run before a double and triple from sophomores Gabrielle Debevec and Alaina Miller sent in three more runs for a 12-1 advantage.
When it was all said and done, Illinois stood victorious by a 14-2 margin. 
The Illini have lost a fair share of their starting lineup from last year, and even before fall games started, it was clear that the veteran presence of Ryono would be extremely valuable. Just three games in, it’s somehow even more clear how important Ryono is for Illinois.
“Business as usual (for Ryono),” said Perry. “Kelly works extremely hard and I think she’s really starting to come into her own, really figure out who she is as a player and what she can bring to the table. It’s great to see she’s always on the hunt, she’s looking for something to smash. I also think she’s starting to rub off on Megan Ward and Stevie Mead. Those guys are up there just cutting and hunting for something they can devour.”
Celebrations were short-lived after the victory over Wabash Valley, as just 30 minutes later, the first pitch was thrown against Kaskaskia. 
The Illini were getting on base, being patient at the plate and being aggressive base runners through the first two innings, but they came up dry in the runs department. Fortunately, stout defense and excellent pitching from junior Lauren Wiles kept the score even until the offense got going in the third.
In an absolute disaster of an inning for Kaskaskia, the action began with senior infielder Megan Ward doubling. From there, she stole third and was eventually sent home by Ryono. Sophomore infielder Sydney Malott hit a laser into the pitcher and was able to reach second with the opponents distracted by the abnormal play. Kaskaskia then walked three straight batters to send two more runs home, loading the bases for three straight at bats before a groundout to third base ended the inning.
Illinois refused to look back and cruised to its most explosive scoring performance of the weekend (16-2). Being held scoreless through two innings was evidently not something that held the players back from their most impressive offensive performance so far and in Perry’s book, not much changed in Illinois’ approach as the game progressed.
“We were attacking, which is always our M.O.,” said Perry. “It was tough because I think it took a minute for the pitcher to settle in for Kaskaskia. It was kind of an interesting ball-strike ratio. But we kept attacking and we finally found our niche, started to get on base and get clutch hits with people in scoring position. As the game went on we started to settle in and find our own rhythm.”
Illinois softball will be back in action for a similar format of games this week, featuring a game against Parkland College on Thursday night and a weekend doubleheader on Saturday.

Fortunately, messing around and low-quality softball are not in Illinois’ DNA, as they did not slack on either end of the plate and the players were looking to score in every inning while bringing it all on the defensive end.
“I enjoyed the execution of our offense,” said Perry. “We executed signals, situational hitting. I thought we had a strong showing in that area and set the tone. On the pitching side, I thought our newcomer, Bri Bower, started us off with a strong note, Juliana Hooker came in and played a significant role and our freshman, Mallory Sluder, brought a lot to our game as well.”

There was no doubt on Friday, and just one inning into the Sunday slate, it was clear there would be no doubt once again. The Illini put three runs on the board in the bottom of the first before adding on three more in the second and two more in the third. Despite all of this, it was the fourth inning that was most impressive. Fifth-year outfielder Kelly Ryono started things off with a solo home run before a double and triple from sophomores Gabrielle Debevec and Alaina Miller sent in three more runs for a 12-1 advantage.
When it was all said and done, Illinois stood victorious by a 14-2 margin. 
The Illini have lost a fair share of their starting lineup from last year, and even before fall games started, it was clear that the veteran presence of Ryono would be extremely valuable. Just three games in, it’s somehow even more clear how important Ryono is for Illinois.
“Business as usual (for Ryono),” said Perry. “Kelly works extremely hard and I think she’s really starting to come into her own, really figure out who she is as a player and what she can bring to the table. It’s great to see she’s always on the hunt, she’s looking for something to smash. I also think she’s starting to rub off on Megan Ward and Stevie Mead. Those guys are up there just cutting and hunting for something they can devour.”
Celebrations were short-lived after the victory over Wabash Valley, as just 30 minutes later, the first pitch was thrown against Kaskaskia. 
The Illini were getting on base, being patient at the plate and being aggressive base runners through the first two innings, but they came up dry in the runs department. Fortunately, stout defense and excellent pitching from junior Lauren Wiles kept the score even until the offense got going in the third.
In an absolute disaster of an inning for Kaskaskia, the action began with senior infielder Megan Ward doubling. From there, she stole third and was eventually sent home by Ryono. Sophomore infielder Sydney Malott hit a laser into the pitcher and was able to reach second with the opponents distracted by the abnormal play. Kaskaskia then walked three straight batters to send two more runs home, loading the bases for three straight at bats before a groundout to third base ended the inning.
Illinois refused to look back and cruised to its most explosive scoring performance of the weekend (16-2). Being held scoreless through two innings was evidently not something that held the players back from their most impressive offensive performance so far and in Perry’s book, not much changed in Illinois’ approach as the game progressed.
“We were attacking, which is always our M.O.,” said Perry. “It was tough because I think it took a minute for the pitcher to settle in for Kaskaskia. It was kind of an interesting ball-strike ratio. But we kept attacking and we finally found our niche, started to get on base and get clutch hits with people in scoring position. As the game went on we started to settle in and find our own rhythm.”
Illinois softball will be back in action for a similar format of games this week, featuring a game against Parkland College on Thursday night and a weekend doubleheader on Saturday.

Outfielder Kelly Ryono set to sprint from the plate on Mar. 29 during a game against Indiana. 
The Illini will be facing off against Parkland on Thursday.
Illinois softball kicked off its eight-game slate of fall exhibitions last Friday against Lake Land College. Two days later, the Illini were back on the field for the Illini Fall Classic, where they took both legs of a doubleheader against Wabash Valley and Kaskaskia. Through the three contests, Illinois outscored its opponents 42-6 and went 3-0.

After a 2023 campaign that saw Illinois softball finish with an overall record of 29-27 and a 6-16 mark in conference play, it will now host a series of fall exhibition games at Eichelberger Field in preparation for the 2024 season.
First on the menu is Lake Land College, who will be traveling to Champaign on Thursday night for a 7 p.m. first pitch. The Lakers have already participated in two exhibition games of their own, falling 3-2 to the Bradley Braves while their meeting with Wisconsin was not recorded. 
The two schools have never faced off in the regular season, but Lake Land has quite the reputation in the NJCAA. Last season, they finished with an astonishing regular season record of 46-10 with a 36-4 total against GRAC opponents. All this was good for the label of GRAC champions on top of a plethora of All-GRAC awards. Illinois has the fortune of not having to face GRAC player of the year Eva Richardson, as she is no longer on Lake Land’s roster and appears to be transferring schools for the upcoming season.
Following that matchup, Illinois will take the field for the Illini Fall Classic on Sunday. The first leg will start at 11 a.m. against Wabash Valley College, with a game against Kaskaskia College immediately after at 1:30 p.m. Each of these teams has also never played against Illinois in the regular season.
Wabash Valley is also a member of the NJCAA’s GRAC and was swept in the NJCAA Region 24 series by Lake Land last year. Although faltering in recent seasons to Lake Land, Wabash Valley has a very solid history of dominance in the GRAC. The Lady Warriors claimed five of six GRAC championships from 2014-2019, on top of being GRAC Runner Up in 2021. 


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Kaskaskia is no walk in the park either, going 49-18 last season with an impressive 30-10 record against conference opponents. On top of this, the Blue Angels were NJCAA Region 24 Champions last season, advancing past each of the other squads Illinois will face this weekend.
Illinois, on the other hand, has had a pretty active offseason both on the field and in the coaching staff. Head coach Tyra Perry, who was hired in the summer of 2015 as Illinois softball’s second head coach ever, was extended through the 2027 season. On top of that, five-year ace Sydney Sickles was brought on as an assistant coach now that she no longer had athletic eligibility. 
On top of retaining familiar faces, Perry brought in Kirsten Verdun to be an assistant coach who primarily works with the pitchers. Verdun spent eight seasons with the Wisconsin Badgers after serving as a graduate assistant with Louisville in 2014-15. 
“We’re really excited to have her (Verdun) with us,” Perry said. “She is a tremendous pitch caller, among other things, especially when you’re in heated moments. She does a great job preparing pitchers for those moments.”
As far as pitching personnel is concerned for the fall stretch, Illinois is only returning two veterans, senior Tori McQueen and junior Lauren Wiles. With the remaining three seeing little to no action as an Illini, the fall will be critical for getting them up to speed and ready to be key pieces of the rotation. 
“Tori McQueen and Lauren Wiles will pitch throughout the eight games this fall but it will be in a limited fashion,” Perry said. “Just to kind of get them acclimated to coach V’s (Verdun’s) system. But you’ll mainly see our other three.” 
One of those three primary pitchers for the fall is transfer Bri Bower, a right-handed pitcher from Mississippi State, who joins Illinois as a junior. Princeton outfielder Serena Starks is Illinois’ only other transfer and is listed as a graduate student. 
Illinois has a younger group this season, with 10 of their 23 players being underclassmen and seven completely new faces. A steady presence throughout her four years as an Illinois undergrad, outfielder Kelly Ryono will be even more key entering her fifth year in orange and blue.
“We’re excited about Kelly Ryono,” Perry said. “Kelly plays high level softball so we’re super excited that she has remained with us, and I think she is going to make a great impact on our season this year.”

In preparation for the upcoming season, the Illinois swimming and diving team faced off in its annual Orange vs. Blue intrasquad meet this Saturday. Strong efforts came from both teams, ultimately concluding with a Blue victory (150) over Orange (138). 
The intrasquad meet began with the 400-yard medley relay, with the Orange team dominating in the breaststroke legs of the event. Orange came out victorious in this first event, finishing with a time of 4:00:36 with swimmers junior Logan Kuehne, sophomore Sara Jass, freshman Abby Ninan and junior Sydney Stoll. 
Sydney Stoll, the freestyle swimmer competing on the Orange team, succeeded in multiple facets of this meet. She competed in the 400-yard medley relay, 100-yard backstroke, 150-yard backstroke and 100-yard IM. 
“We were all very excited,” Stoll noted. “We’ve been training for about six weeks now, we were ready to race, we’ve been racing a little bit in practice, so everyone was super excited, and it was a good way to kickstart the season before our first real meet.” 
Stoll’s first individual event was the 100-yard backstroke, in which she raced to first place, ending with a time of 57:26 over five other swimmers. She situated herself firmly on the diving board and launched herself backward into the water, making long strides as she swam the four laps in the pool.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

“I just think about how long the race really is compared to what I do in a practice,” Stoll said. “In practice, we do way more, so I try to put it in perspective and tell myself that it’s gonna hurt, but you can push through the pain.” 
After the penultimate race, the Orange team got ahead of Blue from a 58:25 win from Stoll in the 100-yard IM, bringing the score to 114 to 110. The deciding factor in the outcome of the meet was the 5×110-yard freestyle relay, with the Blue team finishing strong to come out on top against Orange. 
Despite the 12-point deficit behind the Blue team, Stoll and the other swimmers on the Orange side left the meet with great attitudes, ready to continue the season against upcoming contenders.
Additionally, noteworthy performances came from many freshmen divers, including Matilda Garcia, Bethany Mercer, Elleka Boeres, Danielle O’Kelly and Elle Crisostomo. The freshmen, along with their senior counterpart, Taylor Michael, all gracefully dove into the pool with sharp entries from the three-meter diving board, with tight synchronization with their diving partners. 
The team, led by head coach Jeana Kempe, was proud of the work they demonstrated in the pool today and elaborated on the spirit of the swimmers overall.
“I thought from an energy standpoint, they were ready to go,” Kempe said. “This is always a fun meet. They’ve been talking smack all week to each other. … However, I thought this year we were exponentially better than we were last year, so I am really excited about that.” 
There was a beaming atmosphere in the facility today, with fans and swimmers cheering their loudest, even if it was just an intrasquad meet. 
Kempe has started her second season as head coach with high hopes for the swimming and diving team. She anticipates fierce competition going into next week against Kansas.
“We talk about it all the time; details are always important, right?” Kempe said. “For us, it’s going to be relay exchanges and really just getting in sync, ready to go. Kansas is going to be a really tough meet. It’s going to be a really close meet. …We talked about every point mattering and every person really participating. It’s a big deal.”

The Illinois swim & dive team met at the ARC on Oct. 7. The blue squad raced the orange squad in a series of events.

The Illinois swimming and diving team is gearing up for the regular season with its annual intrateam Orange vs. Blue meet. Even though the Blue team has held a winning streak in the past, the Orange team pulled out a narrow win last year (66-63). The year before saw a dominant 122.5-101.5  victory in favor of the Blue team, so the team who will come home with this year’s bragging rights is quite the tossup. Illinois’ season opener begins at 10 a.m. this Saturday at the ARC’s pool, with nonconference away meets starting up in the following weeks.
The Illini have been on an upward trend as of late, finishing last season with an overall record of 6-3 and earning a 5-4 mark the year prior. This could be a sign that things are looking positive for the Illini this season regarding their meets. It is conference placement, however, where things get tricky. Despite earning its most points since 2015-16, Illinois did not do well in the Big Ten Championships last season. Out of the 12 Big Ten schools participating, the Illini finished in 10th, 12th, 12th and 11th on days one through four respectively. 
Looking over Illinois’ stats in recent years, the team has a tendency to perform better when it comes to nonconference opponents versus Big Ten opponents. In each of the Illini’s last five seasons, they have been defeated in three of their four conference meets. As can be inferred by Illinois’ previously mentioned 6-3 record last season, it was 5-0 against nonconference opponents.
An interesting feature of Illinois’ 2023-24 schedule is having UCLA as a nonconference opponent. In the coming years that meet will become conference play, so it will be interesting to see if Illinois’ dominance against nonconference opponents applies to UCLA in the present and can be continued into the future.
Each year there are bound to be new faces; however, this year in particular is big for the Illini. Twelve of Illinois’ 34 athletes are freshmen.

The Illinois swimming and diving team is gearing up for the regular season with its annual intrateam Orange vs. Blue meet. Even though the Blue team has held a winning streak in the past, the Orange team pulled out a narrow win last year (66-63). The year before saw a dominant 122.5-101.5  victory in favor of the Blue team, so the team who will come home with this year’s bragging rights is quite the tossup. Illinois’ season opener begins at 10 a.m. this Saturday at the ARC’s pool, with nonconference away meets starting up in the following weeks.
The Illini have been on an upward trend as of late, finishing last season with an overall record of 6-3 and earning a 5-4 mark the year prior. This could be a sign that things are looking positive for the Illini this season regarding their meets. It is conference placement, however, where things get tricky. Despite earning its most points since 2015-16, Illinois did not do well in the Big Ten Championships last season. Out of the 12 Big Ten schools participating, the Illini finished in 10th, 12th, 12th and 11th on days one through four respectively. 
Looking over Illinois’ stats in recent years, the team has a tendency to perform better when it comes to nonconference opponents versus Big Ten opponents. In each of the Illini’s last five seasons, they have been defeated in three of their four conference meets. As can be inferred by Illinois’ previously mentioned 6-3 record last season, it was 5-0 against nonconference opponents.
An interesting feature of Illinois’ 2023-24 schedule is having UCLA as a nonconference opponent. In the coming years that meet will become conference play, so it will be interesting to see if Illinois’ dominance against nonconference opponents applies to UCLA in the present and can be continued into the future.
Each year there are bound to be new faces; however, this year in particular is big for the Illini. Twelve of Illinois’ 34 athletes are freshmen. It is still early and the utility of each new addition remains to be seen, but such a large overhaul may be what the Illini need to start a new era of Big Ten competitiveness.

Illinois women’s tennis spent its last two weeks separated, with head coach Evan Clark taking a group to the Baylor-hosted H-E-B Invite and associate head coach Jacob Eddins traveling to North Carolina for the ITA All-American Championships. Clark’s group was originally only missing junior Megan Heuser, the lone Illini to qualify for the ITA singles draw, but Heuser was eventually joined by senior Kate Duong for the main doubles draw.
The action began in Texas on Sept. 29 and featured an even number of singles and doubles matches. The success, however, was not as even across the two forms of play. Sophomore Violeta Martinez and freshman Alice Xu were the lone Illini to win in singles compared to an impressive 6-2 team effort in doubles. 
Despite this being Xu’s first-ever tournament at the collegiate level, she totaled two straight-set victories by the end of the weekend. 
“In juniors, you get a warm-up round, and the competition starts out not as strong and then gets stronger as the draw goes along,” Xu said. “Here, everyone is playing D1 tennis, and everyone is obviously very good, so it was very nerve-wracking for it to be my first collegiate tournament. You want to start off strong, and I’m thankful that I was able to do that.”
Saturday featured a script-flipping day two of action down south. Compared to the previous day, Illinois dominated in singles and came up short in doubles. Missouri was Illinois’ opponent of the day in singles, and senior Mae Canete was the only Tiger who emerged victorious.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

Things did not fare as well for Heuser in the east, who was trying to work her way out of the pre-qualifying singles draw. Heuser fought and even pushed the first set to 12 games but was bested by an opponent from Georgia with 7-5 and 6-1 losses.
Moving on to Sunday, Illinois closed out its bid in the H-E-B Invite with a one-sided day in singles and a solid doubles outing. Sophomore transfer McKenna Schaefbauer worked with fifth-year Josie Frazier to take a commanding 6-3 victory against Tennessee, but it was Martinez’s third win that headlined the day. Much like Xu, this was Martinez’s first collegiate fall competition after only participating in last year’s spring season due to injury.
“I was definitely excited because it was my first fall,” Martinez said. “I worked very hard in the summer because, even though I started last year in spring, I still wasn’t feeling my best. Coming from an injury is hard, and I didn’t get a lot of the reps that I wanted to, so in summer, I just tried to train a lot to be healthy for the fall season.”
Things also looked brighter for Heuser, who pulled out a straight-set victory in her pre-qualifying consolation round.
Three days later, on Oct. 4, Illinois’ All-American duo was reunited for their run at the main doubles draw. Duong and Heuser were No. 8 in the tournament and faced an unseeded duo from Alabama, but they were immediately put in a tough spot after dropping the first set 6-4. The match drew even tighter in the following frame, where, after 12 games, neither side had gained any ground.
A tiebreaker game was necessary to determine whether or not a third set was on the way, and unfortunately, it never came. Illinois’ top duo played another match in the consolation bracket and got their opportunity at a three-set victory but ultimately fell 6-7, 6-3 and 1-0. 
Rather than be overly critical of such an early tournament against the best of the best, Clark believes this weekend was as good an experience as any for his All-Americans.
“I think they are a little bit low on matches,” Clark said. “(Me) not being there, it’s really tough. I watched a little bit of the first set, but it’s early in the season. No one is really going to remember the results from here, so it’s good for them to get these matches under their belt. Everyone is good in the main draw of All-Americans, so it was just another great opportunity for them.”

Last spring was one to remember for Illinois women’s tennis, who made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2019 on top of having its first doubles All-Americans since 2013, thanks to senior Kate Duong and junior Megan Heuser. However, injuries derailed Illinois’ postseason and cut its run in both the Big Ten and NCAA short.
This year, Illinois reloaded and appears to be as strong as ever. Ashley Yeah and Emily Casati graduated, but Josie Frazier returns for a fifth year, as does an impressive class of newcomers. The most experienced of them, South Carolina sophomore transfer McKenna Schaefbauer, makes her return to the Midwest after spending much of her childhood training at Atkins Tennis Center. 
“I’ve known McKenna for a long time, since she was a little kid,” said head coach Evan Clark. “She used to come here and play tennis … with an instructor that was here. I’ve known the family forever. We recruited pretty hard in juniors, and we just didn’t get her. I was pretty bummed that we didn’t get her, but it’s all worked out for the best. She’s doing great so far, we’re super happy to have her.”
This left just one of Illinois’ eight scholarship spots open for a true freshman. The final spot was filled by Alice Xu, a five-star recruit who was ranked as high as No. 19 in her class and was the top ranked player in Virginia for five years straight. Thus, every scholarship spot on the roster has been utilized to the fullest, but it somehow gets even better for the Illini. 
Rosie Seccia, a four-star freshman from IMG Academy walked on for Illinois. This is the first time the Illini have had more than eight on the roster since 2020-21. Getting as high as No. 5 in the state of New York and being ranked as a top 100 recruit for her final three years of high school, Seccia’s pedigree as a walk-on is almost unheard of.


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

The combination of retaining six players, five of whom are upperclassmen, coupled with an excellent transfer and two highly ranked freshmen has given Clark confidence.
“It’s probably the most depth we’ve ever had, to be honest,” Clark said. “One through nine. You come watch practice, there’s like no easy matches any day in doubles and singles. It’s exciting, this is year seven for me and I finally feel like I’ve got the deepest team I’ve ever had, which could be a good thing and could be a bad thing. There’s a lot of tough decisions to make at some point.”
Eight of the nine travel to Waco, Texas for Baylor’s H-E-B invitational this Friday, while Heuser and associate head coach Jacob Eddins head to Cary, North Carolina for the ITA All-American Championships. Heuser was placed in the pre-qualifying singles draw, where she will try to earn a bid to the subsequent qualifying and main draws. After some action down south, Duong will join her All-American counterpart for the main doubles draw which begins the following Wednesday.
Clark’s mindset going into the fall season is to simply get each member of the team as much experience as possible. 
“I think everyone just kind of needs matches to see where they’re shaping up,” Clark said. “I think it will be a good measuring stick for everyone this weekend. The tournament is really tough, there’s a bunch of really good teams, so every match will just be an opportunity for some of them to see where they’re at and hopefully get some good wins.”

Through the 32 doubles matches that junior Kate Duong and sophomore Megan Heuser shared the court in, they had an astonishing record of 26-6 that was headlined by a 6-4 victory over the No. 2 duo in the country, Miller and Brown from Michigan. But in the weeks leading up to the NCAA doubles tournament, it appeared as if Illinois’ star duo would not get the opportunity to compete due an injury to Duong. A fractured left wrist had kept Duong out of one regular season match, two Big Ten tournament matches and a first round NCAA championship appearance. The Illini claimed just one of the four available doubles points and only won one match during that stretch.
Although her injury had not completely healed by the time of the NCAA doubles tournament, the opportunity to compete against the best of the best was simply too enticing. For the first time in a month, Duong took the floor with a brace-adorned left wrist and a desire to go out with a bang. 
“Missing my team’s postseason made me a little bit hungrier to get on the court,” Duong said. “I love playing and I’ve never really taken three, four weeks off from the team. It definitely put me in a position where having that mentality of ‘nothing to lose’ and having the motivation from not playing for the past four weeks really motivated me to play my best tennis and put everything out there, especially for Megan (Heuser).”
Under normal circumstances, entering the most challenging tournament of the year with a considerable amount of rust and a lingering injury would be a death sentence. However, Heuser chose a different approach.
“I honestly think the break helped us,” Heuser said. “Playing with someone different kind of relaxed me. When I am playing with someone else, I don’t have any pressure to uphold a ranking or uphold a ‘We have to win this match because we have to make the tournament because we had such a great season.’ Coming into the tournament … I was relaxed and I felt more comfortable on the court.”


From the football field to the tennis court, stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest.

As early as the first serve of the tournament, it was clear the duo hadn’t missed a beat. They came out and slapped a duo from Fresno State in the face with a lopsided 6-1 first set victory. Even though this was followed by a much tighter second set, Duong and Heuser closed out the match in straight sets (6-1, 7-6). The win may have been a valuable reconfirmation of the duo’s return to form, but Heuser felt it from the jump.
“When we got back together, everything just clicked again,” Heuser said. “The connection that we had on the court is not just something we’re gonna lose in a month. I was a little bit nervous going into the match, obviously, but at the end of the day I had to convince myself that no one can take away the season that we had. We’re playing one arm down, basically, and there was no pressure on us to do anything. I think that was really comforting and helped us play really well.”
Duong mirrored this sentiment, and even doubled down on her trust in the unwavering connection they possess.
“I have been playing with her (Heuser) for years,” Duong said. “We know each other really well. Even if I took two months off, nothing would have been different.”
The hot streak lived on in the sweet 16, where Duong and Heuser rallied for a victory even after dropping behind 5-7 in the first set. All-American status was given to each of the two Illini for advancing to the elite eight, a feat that no member of Illinois women’s tennis has accomplished since 2013 and the first of whom to do so under head coach Evan Clark. 
“They’re a great team and they are very deserving of several things,” Clark said. “It’s just a really unique story with her going down and her playing in the cast. We certainly knew what they were capable of but with Kate’s injury it made you question a little bit. What they did at the NCAA tournament with her still being in a cast … it was pretty remarkable.”
Their magical run was unfortunately brought to a close by a duo from Virginia in the following round. But even though the short-term goal is always to survive and advance, plenty of legendary heights had been reached by one of Illinois’ best duos of all time. Heuser in particular had the pleasure of scratching out a fair share of season and lifelong goals. 
“At the beginning of the fall, I made three goals,” Heuser explained. “The three goals I made were to make NCAAs as a team, which we did, to make NCAAs for doubles, which we did, and then to become an All-American. My dream was always to play at a big D-I school and be an All-American so that is something little-me will be proud of forever. That’s something that stays with me forever and something that lives as a legacy at Illinois forever. I am super grateful and humbled to have that honor at Illinois.”

Doubles partners Kate Duong (front) and Megan Heuser (rear) hype each other up between serves.

Through the 32 doubles matches that junior Kate Duong and sophomore Megan Heuser shared the court in, they had an astonishing record of 26-6 that was headlined by a 6-4 victory over the No. 2 duo in the country, Miller and Brown from Michigan. But in the weeks leading up to the NCAA doubles tournament, it appeared as if Illinois’ star duo would not get the opportunity to compete due an injury to Duong. A fractured left wrist had kept Duong out of one regular season match, two Big Ten tournament matches and a first round NCAA championship appearance. The Illini claimed just one of the four available doubles points and only won one match during that stretch.
Although her injury had not completely healed by the time of the NCAA doubles tournament, the opportunity to compete against the best of the best was simply too enticing. For the first time in a month, Duong took the floor with a brace-adorned left wrist and a desire to go out with a bang. 
“Missing my team’s postseason made me a little bit hungrier to get on the court,” Duong said. “I love playing and I’ve never really taken three, four weeks off from the team. It definitely put me in a position where having that mentality of ‘nothing to lose’ and having the motivation from not playing for the past four weeks really motivated me to play my best tennis and put everything out there, especially for Megan (Heuser).”
Under normal circumstances, entering the most challenging tournament of the year with a considerable amount of rust and a lingering injury would be a death sentence. However, Heuser chose a different approach.
“I honestly think the break helped us,” Heuser said. “Playing with someone different kind of relaxed me. When I am playing with someone else, I don’t have any pressure to uphold a ranking or uphold a ‘We have to win this match because we have to make the tournament because we had such a great season.’ Coming into the tournament … I was relaxed and I felt more comfortable on the court.”
As early as the first serve of the tournament, it was clear the duo hadn’t missed a beat. They came out and slapped a duo from Fresno State in the face with a lopsided 6-1 first set victory. Even though this was followed by a much tighter second set, Duong and Heuser closed out the match in straight sets (6-1, 7-6). The win may have been a valuable reconfirmation of the duo’s return to form, but Heuser felt it from the jump.
“When we got back together, everything just clicked again,” Heuser said. “The connection that we had on the court is not just something we’re gonna lose in a month. I was a little bit nervous going into the match, obviously, but at the end of the day I had to convince myself that no one can take away the season that we had. We’re playing one arm down, basically, and there was no pressure on us to do anything. I think that was really comforting and helped us play really well.”
Duong mirrored this sentiment, and even doubled down on her trust in the unwavering connection they possess.
“I have been playing with her (Heuser) for years,” Duong said. “We know each other really well. Even if I took two months off, nothing would have been different.”
The hot streak lived on in the sweet 16, where Duong and Heuser rallied for a victory even after dropping behind 5-7 in the first set. All-American status was given to each of the two Illini for advancing to the elite eight, a feat that no member of Illinois women’s tennis has accomplished since 2013 and the first of whom to do so under head coach Evan Clark. 
“They’re a great team and they are very deserving of several things,” Clark said. “It’s just a really unique story with her going down and her playing in the cast. We certainly knew what they were capable of but with Kate’s injury it made you question a little bit. What they did at the NCAA tournament with her still being in a cast … it was pretty remarkable.”
Their magical run was unfortunately brought to a close by a duo from Virginia in the following round. But even though the short-term goal is always to survive and advance, plenty of legendary heights had been reached by one of Illinois’ best duos of all time. Heuser in particular had the pleasure of scratching out a fair share of season and lifelong goals. 
“At the beginning of the fall, I made three goals,” Heuser explained. “The three goals I made were to make NCAAs as a team, which we did, to make NCAAs for doubles, which we did, and then to become an All-American. My dream was always to play at a big D-I school and be an All-American so that is something little-me will be proud of forever. That’s something that stays with me forever and something that lives as a legacy at Illinois forever. I am super grateful and humbled to have that honor at Illinois.”
